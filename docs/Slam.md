Pilots can SLAM by activating their SubLight Acceleration Motors and careening through space at incredible speeds. A ship performs a :slam: action by performing the following steps:

1. The player chooses a [maneuver](/rules/Maneuver) from the ship's [dial](/rules/Dial). The maneuver must match the [speed](/rules/Speed) of the maneuver that the ship executed this round.
2. The ship executes the chosen maneuver.
3. The ship gains one [disarm](/rules/Disarm) token.

A ship can perform a :slam: action only during its activation in the Activation Phase. Therefore a ship cannot perform a :slam: action if it is granted an action at any other time.

- A :slam: action fails if the final position of the ship would cause it to [flee](/rules/Flee).
- When a ship performs a :slam: action, it has performed an action as well as executed a maneuver for the sake of abilities.
