Ships can sometimes be placed in reserve from card effects. A ship that is
placed in reserve is placed on its ship card. While a ship is in reserve, it is
not assigned a dial, it cannot perform actions, and it cannot attack.

- A ship that is placed in reserve will have an effect that causes it to be placed in the play area.
- Ships that are placed in reserve are not [removed from the game](/rules/Removed_From_The_Game).
- The [abilities](/rules/Abilities) of a ship in reserve are inactive unless the ability explicitly allows it to be used while it is in reserve.
- A ship that is [docked](/rules/Dock) is placed in reserve.
- During the [End Phase](/rules/End_Phase), a ship that is in reserve still removes all circular [tokens](/rules/Tokens) and recovers [charges](/rules/Charge) on all of its cards with recurring charge icons.
