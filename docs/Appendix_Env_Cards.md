**ENVIRONMENT CARDS** are cards containing special rules that simulate environmental conditions of the battlefield, such as ion clouds, unexploded munitions, or meteor showers. Each card offer players a way to quickly add a new combination of obstacles and special rules to their games. 

Environment cards are meant for casual play, and are an excellent option to add a twist to home games, local events, and even **Epic Battles** scenarios.

## ANATOMY OF AN ENVIRONMENT CARD

Each environment card lists a set of components to be gathered during Setup, as well as rules for their use.

## CHOOSING TO USE ENVIRONMENT CARDS

To play a scenario using Environment cards, both players should first agree to use them.

## USING ENVIRONMENT CARDS

During the Gather Forces step of Setup, shuffle the Environment cards and randomly deal one. Each environment card has additional rules while placing obstacles, and many have additional special rules during play. For instance, some introduce devices into the play area, or add new rules to existing obstacles, or even cause objects to move during play.

## VICTORY COUNTERS

Some scenarios have **VICTORY COUNTERS** that are used as markers in the play area, used to track progress, or scored for completing goals during play. These are represented in text with the :point: icon.

> Vicotry Counters

Environment cards use victory counters only as markers, and not for scoring. Each environment card that uses victory counters explains their use in that scenario.
