When building a squad, a player can field upgrades for their ships by paying their associated loadout point cost. When building a squad u, each ship will have a loadout value and an upgrade bar that shows how many and which types of upgrades that ship can equip.

Some upgrade cards have one or more of the following rules in their restrictions box:

- **Rebel/Imperial/Scum:** This upgrade can be equipped only to a ship of the specified faction.
- **Small/Medium/Large/Huge ship:** This upgrade can be equipped only to a ship of the specified [size](/rules/Ship_Sizes).
- **Ship-type:** If there is a type of ship listed, this upgrade can be equipped only to a ship of the specified type.
- **Action:** If there is an action icon, this upgrade can be equipped only to a ship with that action on its action bar. This does not include actions on its linked action bar.

- A ship cannot equip more than one copy of the same card.
- A squad's cards are restricted by the rules of [limited](/rules/Limited) and [solitary](/rules/Solitary) cards.
- Some effects can “exchange” or “equip” an upgrade card from one ship to another during or after setup.
      + An effect can move an upgrade to a ship that does not have the matching icon on its upgrade bar.
      + An effect cannot move an upgrade to a ship that does not meet the requirements set out in the restrictions box of the upgrade card unless the effect says to equip the upgrade “ignoring restrictions.”
