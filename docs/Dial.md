Each ship type has its own unique dial. All expansion products contain a dial for each ship in that product. Dials are used during the [Planning Phase](/rules/Planning_Phase) to secretly select maneuvers.

- When a player is instructed to set a ship's dial, the player can choose the same maneuver that it already has selected unless stated otherwise.
- Players are not allowed to touch or look at their opponents' facedown dials. If a player wishes to touch or look at their own facedown dial, they must inform their opponent they wish to do so before touching the dial.
- Each [faction](/rules/Faction) has its own Maneuver Dial Upgrade Kit. These dials assemble slightly differently than the standard dials and use a curved indicator below the [maneuver](/rules/Maneuver) instead to indicate selected maneuvers.
