An arc is an area formed between the lines created by extending hash marks or arc lines printed on a ship token to range 3. A ship is **IN** an arc if any part of its base is inside that area.

- Arcs are measured beyond the base of ships. The portion of any object that lies beneath a ship is not in any of those ship's arcs.

### Standard Arcs

There are three types of **STANDARD ARCS** created from the crossed diagonal arc lines:

![Ships Arcs](standard_ship_arcs.webp)

1. **Front arc (:front-arc:):** This arc projects in the same direction that the ship is facing. Most ships have a primary :front-arc: weapon. Almost all :cannon:, :torpedo:, and :missile: weapons use this arc.

1. **Side arcs (:left-arc:,:right-arc:)** These arcs are on the left (:left-arc:) or right (:right-arc:) side of ships.

1. **Rear arc (:rear-arc:)** This arc projects in the opposite direction that the ship is facing. Some ships have a primary :rear-arc: weapon.

### Bullseye Arc

Inside of the front arc, each ship has a bullseye arc.

![Bullseye Arc](ship_bullseye_arc.webp)

**Bullseye arc (:bulls-eye-arc:):** This arc is found inside the :front-arc:. If something is in a ship's :bulls-eye-arc:, it is also in its :front-arc:.

- The :bulls-eye-arc: is the width and length of the range ruler.

- There is no intrinsic effect when a ship attacks a ship in its :bulls-eye-arc:, but card [abilities](/rules/Abilities) may refer to it.

### Full Arcs

There are two **FULL ARCS** that use the midway line instead of the printed arc lines.

![Full Arc](ship_full_arcs.webp)

1. **Full front arc (:full-front-arc:):** This arc covers all of the area in front of the ship. Some ships have primary :full-front-arc: weapons.

1. Full rear arc (:full-rear-arc:): This arc covers all of the area behind the ship.

Using the :full-front-arc:, :full-rear-arc:, and extending the midway line to range 3, the following phrases are used to express specific spacial relationships between ships.

- **Behind:** If ship A is in the :full-rear-arc: of ship B and ship A does not cross the midway line of ship B, then ship A is **BEHIND** ship B.

- **In front of:** If ship A is in the :full-front-arc: of ship B and ship A does not cross the midway line of ship B, then ship A is **IN FRONT OF** ship B

- **Flanking:** If ship A crosses the midway line of ship B, then ship A is **FLANKING** ship B.

### Turret Arcs

Unlike other arcs, some weapons use turret arc indicators to select arcs. There are two types of turret arc indicators: single turret (:single-turret-arc:) and double turret (:double-turret-arc:). During [setup](/rules/Setup), a ship with a [primary](/rules/Primary_Weapon) (or [special](/rules/Special_Weapon)) :single-turret-arc: or :double-turret-arc: weapon adds the corresponding turret arc indicator to its base.

![Turret Arcs](ship_turret_arcs.webp)

The turret arc indicator points toward one of the ship's four standard arcs. The standard arc that the turret arc indicator is pointing toward is a :single-turret-arc: in addition to still being a standard arc. While a ship performs a :single-turret-arc: attack, it can attack a target that is in its :single-turret-arc: arc.

A ship with a double turret arc indicator has two :single-turret-arc: in opposite directions.

A ship can adjust which standard arc(s) that its turret arc indicator is pointing towards by using the [rotate](/rules/Rotate) (:rotate-arc:) action.

![Double Turret Arc Indicator](double_turret_indicator.webp)

> Double Turret Arc Indicator

Huge ships have additional rules for turret arc indicators (see [Appendix: Huge Ships](/rules/Huge_Ships))

### Firing Arcs

A ship's **FIRING ARCS** include all shaded arcs on the ship's ship token plus all :single-turret-arc: arcs, if any.

- If an upgrade card gives a ship a :single-turret-arc: arc or primary weapon with a specified arc, those arcs are also firing arcs.
