To represent that ships with the same initiative are essentially attacking at the same time, if a ship is [destroyed](/rules/Destroyed) during the [Engagement Phase](/rules/Engagement_Phase), it is [removed](/rules/Removed_From_The_Game) after all ships that have the same initiative as the currently engaged ship have engaged.
