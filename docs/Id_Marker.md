ID markers relate ships in the play area to their respective ship card and any [locks](/rules/Lock) they have. Players must assign ID markers to each of their ships during [setup](/rules/Setup).

To assign an ID marker to a ship, the player places one ID marker on the ship's card. Then they insert the two corresponding ID markers into the tower of the ship's base. The color of the number on the sides that face outward must match the color of the faceup marker on the ship card.

- Players can color their ID markers, (using a marker, brush, etc.) so long as all of their fielded ships match.
- During setup, players must be able to clearly differentiate which ships are on each side by using differently colored ID markers.
