Some upgrade cards have the **STANDARDIZED** restriction. During squad
building, if a player selects a ship with a standardized card equipped, each
ship of that ship type included in that player's squad must be equipped with a
copy of that standardized card if it has the ship ability referenced by that card.

- Standard loadouts cannot equip additional upgrades and ignore the
  standardized restriction.
