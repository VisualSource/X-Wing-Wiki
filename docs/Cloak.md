Ships can cloak to become difficult to hit, and they can decloak to move unpredictably. When a ship performs the :cloak: action, it gains one cloak token.

![Cloak Token](CloakToken.webp)
> Cloak Token

A ship is **CLOAKED** while it has a cloak token. Cloak tokens are blue [tokens](/rules/Tokens). A cloaked ship has the following effects:

- Its [agility](/rules/Agility) value is increased by 2.
- It is disarmed.
- It cannot perform the cloak action or gain a second cloak token.

During the [System Phase](/rules/System_Phase), each cloaked ship may spend its cloak token to **DECLOAK**. When a small ship decloaks, it must choose one of the following effects:

1. Barrel roll using the [2 :straight:] template.
2. Boost using the [2 :straight:] template.

When a [medium or large](/rules/) ship decloaks, it must choose one of the following effects:

1. [Barrel roll](/rules/Barrel_Roll) using the [1 :straight:] template.
2. [Boost](/rules/Boost) using the [1 :straight:] template.

- Decloaking does not count as executing a [maneuver](/rules/Maneuver) or performing an [action](/rules/Action) but does count as a [move](/rules/Move).
- A ship can decloak even while [stressed](/rules/Stress).
- When a player declares to decloak a ship, that player must declare which type of boost or barrel roll it is going to perform before placing a template on the play area.
- If a decloak fails, the ship is returned to its prior position before it attempted the decloak and the cloak token is not removed.
- Each ship cannot drop or launch a [device](/rules/Device) during the same phase that it decloaked.
