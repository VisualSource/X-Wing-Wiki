desc: The System Phase is the second phase of a round.

The System Phase is the second phase of a [round](/rules/Round). During this phase, the sequence of play starts with the ship with the lowest [initiative](/rules/Initiative) and continues in ascending order.

During this phase, each ship gets an opportunity to choose and resolve any abilities that are explicitly resolved during the System Phase.

- Without having specific upgrades, abilities, or tokens, most ships have no effects that can be resolved during this phase. Some abilities that can be used at this time include [dropping and launching devices](/rules/Deploy), [decloaking](/rules/Cloak),and deploying and docking ships.
- If a player has multiple ships with the same [initiative](/rules/Initiative) value, the player resolves abilities in any order; resolving any abilities for one ship before resolving abilities for another ship of the same initiative value.
- If multiple players have ships with the same initiative value, [player order](/rules/Player_Order) is used to determine the sequence. The first player resolves any abilities of their ships with that initiative value in any order, then the second player resolves any abilities of their ships with that initiative value in any order, and so on.
