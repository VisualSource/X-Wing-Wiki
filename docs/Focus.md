Pilots can focus to concentrate and expand their combat prowess.
When a ship performs the :focus: action, it gains one focus token.

![Focus Token](Focus_Token.webp)

A ship is **FOCUSED** while it has at least one focus token. Focus
tokens are circular, green [tokens](/rules/Tokens). A focused ship follows these rules:

- While a focused ship performs an [attack](/rules/Attack), during the Modify Attack Dice step,
  it may spend a focus token to change all of its :focus: results to :hit: results.

- While a focused ship defends, during the Modify Defense Dice step, it may
  spend a focus token to change all of its :focus: results to :evade: results.

Additionally:

- A ship cannot spend a focus token to change :focus: results to :evade: or :hit:
  results if it does not have any :focus: results.

- If an ability instructs a ship to gain a focus token, this is different than
  performing a :focus: action. A ship that gains a token without performing the
  action can still perform the :focus: action this round.
