Pilots can evade to fly defensively. When a ship performs an :evade: action, it gains one evade token.

A ship is evading while it has at least one evade token. Evade tokes are circular, green [tokens](/rules/Tokens). While an evading ship defends, during the Modify Defense Dice step, it can spend one or more evade tokens to change that many of its blank or :focus: results to :evade: results.

- If an ability instructs a ship to gain an evade token, this is different than performing an :evade: action. A ship that gains the token without performing the action can still perform the :evade: action this round.
