category: ["GLOSSARY"]
desc: "Each maneuver has three components: speed (a number 0-5), difficulty (red, white, blue, or purple), and bearing (an arrow or other symbol)."

Each [maneuver](/rules/Maneuver) has three components: [speed](/rules/Speed) (a number 0-5), difficulty (red,
white, blue, or purple), and [bearing](/rules/Bearing) (an arrow or other symbol).

During the Check Difficulty step of executing a maneuver, if the maneuver is red,
the ship gains one [stress](/rules/Stress) [token](/rules/Token). If it is blue, the ship removes one stress token.
If it is purple, the ship must spend 1 :force: as a cost to execute the maneuver.

- A [stressed](/rules/Stress) ship cannot execute red maneuvers or perform actions.
- If an effect increases the difficulty of a maneuver, blue increases to white, and white increases to red. If an effect decreases the difficulty of a maneuver, red decreases to white, and white decreases to blue. 
    + An [ability](/rules/Abilities) that increases the difficulty of a red maneuver or decreases the difficulty of a blue maneuver can resolve, but has no additional effect. 
    + If multiple abilities change the difficulty of a maneuver, the effects are cumulative. For example, if a ship reveals a red [4 :straight:] maneuver and has one effect that increases the difficulty of the maneuver and another effect that decreases the difficulty, the maneuver is treated as red. 
    + A purple maneuver can never have its difficulty increased or decreased, and a non-purple maneuver's difficulty can never be increased to purple. Another maneuver can be treated as purple by an ability, or a purple maneuver can be treated as another color. For abilities that compare difficulty, purple maneuvers are considered more difficult than non-purple maneuvers and the same difficulty as other purple maneuvers.
