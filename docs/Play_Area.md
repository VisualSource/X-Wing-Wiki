The play area is the defined area on a flat surface on which the ships are placed. After executing a [maneuver](/rules/Maneuver), if any part of a ship's base is outside the play area, that ship has [fled](/rules/Flee). The recommended play area for a standard 20 point game is 3' x 3' (91 cm x 91cm). If playing with other squad point totals, the players can expand or contract the play area in one or both dimensions to create a suitable space for the game.
