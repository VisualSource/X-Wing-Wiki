Each ship has up to two primary weapons listed on its ship card. Each primary weapon has an [arc](/rules/Arc) symbol and a red attack value. During a ship's attack, it chooses a weapon to perform an attack with. If it performs an [attack](/rules/Attack) using a primary weapon, the attack value indicates how many attack dice it rolls during the Roll Attack Dice step and the arc symbol indicates where the defender must be located.

- A primary weapon requires the attack range to be range 0-3 and has no cost by default.
- Since primary weapons are not special weapons, they do not benefit from abilities that trigger while performing a special attack
