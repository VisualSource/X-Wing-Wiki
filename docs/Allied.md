Some ships/[devices](/rules/Device) controlled by the same player are **ALLIED** to each other instead of being [friendly](/rules/Friendly). Allied ships are use by their player much like friendly ships, but do not interact with effects that affect "friendly ships.".

- Ships cannot perform [attacks](/rules/Attack) against allied ships, unless specified otherwise.
- A ship is not friendly to its allied ships, and abilities that affect "friendly ships" do not affect allied ships.
- A ship is not "allied" with itself, and so abilities that affect "allied ships" do not affect the ship that produces them.
