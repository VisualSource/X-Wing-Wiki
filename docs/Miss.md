During the Neutralize Results step of an [attack](/rules/Attack), the attack **misses** if no :hit: or :critical-hit: results remain. The attack [hits](/rules/Hit) if at least one :hit: or :critical-hit: result remain uncanceled.

- If the attack misses, the Deal Damage step of the attack is skipped.
