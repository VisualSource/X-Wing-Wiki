Each player builds a squad by choosing ships whose total squad point cost
does not exceed the total defined by the game mode. The squad point total for
a standard game is 20 points, with a limitation of three to eight ships.

Each ship in a player's squad can be equipped with a number of upgrades,
based on the ship's loadout value. Players build a squad using ship cards,
upgrade cards, and the following rules and restrictions.

## FACTION

Nearly all game modes limit ships to a specific faction. All ship cards must be
from a single faction.

## LIMITED AND SOLITARY CARDS

A squad's cards are restricted by the rules of limited cards and solitary cards.

## BAN LIST

The Ban List is a list of ships and upgrades that are not legal for Standard
play.

Ships on the Ban List cannot be include in squads in Standard play. Upgrades
on the Ban List cannot be added to ships in Standard play.

- Standard loadouts cannot have upgrades added to them, but may include
  upgrades from the Ban List in their loadout. A standard loadout is only
  banned if it appears in the list of banned ships.

## RESTRICTED LIST

The Restricted List is a list of ships and upgrades that are legal for standard
play, with limitations.

During squad building, a total of four ships and upgrades from the Restricted
List can be included in a squad. This could be up to four copies of one
upgrade or ship or a mix of up to four selections from among all the ships and
upgrades on the Restricted List.

## SQUAD POINTS

Each ship card has a squad point cost associated with it. This value is used
during squad building to build lists that are legal for different game modes. A
list of all ship card squad point costs is available at [www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-documents](http://www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-documents).

## LOADOUT VALUE

Each ship has a loadout value that determines how many upgrade cards it can
equip. This value is used during squad building to build lists that are legal for
different game modes. A ship cannot equip more upgrades than its loadout
value. A list of all ships' loadout values is available at [www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-documents](http://www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-documents).

## BUILDER KEYWORDS

Some ships have builder keywords. These keywords are required to equip
certain upgrades. A list of all ships' builder keywords is available at [www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-documents](http://www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-documents).

## UPGRADES

- Each ship has an upgrade bar, which is a list of upgrade icons that limit
  the types of upgrades the ship can equip. A list of all ships' upgrade bars
  is available at [www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-documents](http://www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-documents).
- Each upgrade card has a cost. The combined cost of all upgrades
  equipped on a ship cannot exceed that ship's loadout value.
- A ship cannot equip more than one copy of an upgrade card with the same
  name.
- Some upgrade cards have restrictions listed in their restriction field.
  These restrictions can refer to faction, ship size, ship types, and builder
  keywords. Only ships that match the restrictions of an upgrade can equip
  it.

## LOADOUT POINTS

Each upgrade card has a loadout point cost associated with it. This value
is used during squad building to build lists that are legal for different game
modes. A list of all upgrade card loadout point costs is available at [www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-documents](http://www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-documents).
