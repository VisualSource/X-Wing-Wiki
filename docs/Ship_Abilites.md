Some ships have **SHIP ABILITIES** on their ship cards listed below a pilot ability
or flavor text. Ship [abilities](/rules/Abilities) are the same across all pilots for a type of ship.

- Some ship abilities can have **“ACTION:”** headers. These are called **SHIP
  ABILITY ACTIONS**. These actions are not on a ship's action bar.
