Pilots can coordinate to assist their allies. When a ship performs the :coordinate: action, it coordinates. A **COORDINATING** ship is a ship that is attempting to coordinate by performing the following steps:

1. Measure range from the coordinating ship to any friendly ships.
2. Choose another friendly ship at range 1-2.
3. The chosen ship may perform one action.

Additionally:

- While a ship coordinates, the coordinate fails if no valid ship is chosen. + If the chosen ship attempts to perform an action but that action fails, the coordinate does not fail.

- If an ability instructs a ship to coordinate, this is different than performing a :coordinate: action. + A ship that coordinates without performing the action can still perform the :coordinate: action this round.
