A ship's initiative value is the orange number to the left of the ship's name on its ship card. Initiative is used to determine the order in which ships can use abilities during the [System Phase](/rules/System_Phase), activate during the [Activation Phase](/rules/Activation_Phase), engage during the [Engagement Phase](/rules/Engagement_Phase), and are placed during [setup](/rules/Setup).

- If several abilities alter the initiative of a ship, only the most recent ability is applied.
    + If the most recent effect ends (such as “at the end of the Engagement Phase”), the ship's initiative returns to the initiative established by the most recent ability that is still active.
