There are seven factions in the game: Rebel (The Rebel Alliance), Imperial (The Galactic Empire), Scum (Scum and Villainy), Resistance, First Order, Republic (Grand Army of the Republic), and Separatist (Separatist Alliance). All ship cards and some upgrade cards are aligned to one of these factions. A squad cannot typically contain cards from different factions.

- Upgrade cards can be used by any faction unless they have a [restriction](/rules/Restriction).
