Wings are an exciting new option that allows players to control multiple ships with a single dial.
Wings not only make flying in formation easier, but thery alos speed up play considerably, accelerating resolution even when there are many ships in play. When running three or more ships of the same type in an **Epic Battles** game, we hightly recommend organizing those ships into a wing to help keep the game moving smoothly.

# What are wings?

A wing is a group of mutiple small ships that move together in a formation using a single maneuver dial. Each **WING** consists of one **WING LEADER** and two to five **WINGMATES**. The wing leader executes maneuvers normally using a maneuver dial and a movement template, and the wingmates stay in formation with therir wing leaders by using a wing tool, which is described later.

A player can select a wing leader and form a wing by equipping specific upgrade cards. These upgrade cards nominate a small ship as a wing leader, contain parameters for choosing that wing leader's wingmates, and provide the wing with an ability to use during the game.

> If players are playing with Quick Builds, thery can form wings using the Wing Quick Builds included with the "Epic Battles Expansion" product. Each one includes a wing leader profile, a profile used for wingmates, and a total [threat level](/rules/Threat_Value) for each of the wings it can be used to form.

# Formations

Wings are configured in **FORMATIONS** that consist of up to six ships. Each ship in a wing has specific **WING POSITION** in the formation.

> Each ship's center line is aligned with a line on the wing tool

Players use a full-size wing tool to arrange that hsips in formation. The large wing tool has a line that corresponds to each wing position. To arrage that ships, a player simply aligns each ship's each ship's center line (front, or rear) with the line on the large wing tool that corresponds to that ship's wing position. Each ship's guides (front or rear) should be flush with the wing tool, and each wingmate's full frint arc [:full-front-arc:] must face the same direction as the wing leader's full front arc [:full-front-arc:].

# Gatering Forces

While building as squad, each player who selects an upgrade that forms a wing must choose which eligible ships are part of that wing. Each :command: upgrade that forms a wing sets certain restrictions on which ships can be part of the wing.

During setup, each ship that is part, of a wing is assigned as ID card that determines that ship's position in the formation. Each ID card includes an ID numbers, the name of the ship's position, and a graphic showing the location of that position within the wing's formation.

Each ID card also shows legal formations at setup depending on the number of ships in the wing. The formation graphic on ID cards always uses an arrow to indicate the wing leader.

> Note that if ships are destryed or split, a wing can have "missing" positions that are unfilled.

After a player determines the position for each ship in the wing, that player assigns an ID card to each of those ships. Thhen, instead of placing a ship ID token on each ship's card, its wing ID card is placed beneasth its ship card so the top portion of the ID card is visible. Finally, ID tokens that match the numbers and colors are placed on the base of each ship. There are multiple sets of wing ID cards that are distinguished by the color and shape associated with the ID number. A wing can be assigned cards form any set of ID cards; however, each ship in that wing must be assigned a card form the same set.

# Wings In The Planning Phase

During the [Planning Phase](/rules/Planning_Phase). **only the wing leader is assigned a maneuver dial.** The wingmates are not assigned dials, as they follow the wing leader.

> **Epic Battlse** contains Wing ID cards and ID tokens for 3 wings (blue, gold, and red). For games where players need more than 3 wings, it alos includes a set of Wing ID cards that can be used with the ID tokens form the core set. Because thry are harder to tell apart, from other ship's IDs these should be used only if needed.

# Wing Activation

During the [Activation Phase](/rules/activation_Phase), a wing leader activates as normal according to its initative value. It moves and performs actions following normal rules. Then each of ites wingmates activates in ascending order according to its ID number (left flank, right flank, rear support, left support, and right support). Wingmates use different rules for moving and performing actions, as decribed in the next two sections.

## Wingmate Movement

When a wingmate moves, a player uses a wing tool to place hte ship back into formation with its wing leader. A wingmate is treated as having revealed the same dial as the wing leader and having executed the smae maneuver as the wing leader --this includes the speed, color, and bearing of the wing leader's maneuver.

If a wingmate cannot be placed back into formation because it would overlap another ship, or because it would leave the play area, the wingmate returns to its pervious position and executes the wing leader's revealed maneuver (obeying normal overlap rules if necessary). Then that wingmate ships its Perform Action step and is split from the wing, which is described later. See **Example of a Wingmate Overlapping a Ship**.

If there is potential for a wingmate to overlap another ship when it moves, a player should use a position marker to rack the wingmate's previous position. This practive ensures that the wingmate is returned to the correct position before executing its maneuver.

## Wingmate Actions

During the Activation Phase, after it is moved, each wingmate can perform an action. Unlike the wing leader, a wingmate is limited to the following actions:
- Calculate [:calculate:]
- Evade [:evade:]
- Focus [:focus:]
- Reinforce [:reinforce:]
- Lock [:lock:]

# Splitting And Joining wings

Wingmates can **SPLIT** from their wing, which allows them to behave as an independent ship that used a maneuver dial as normal. Additionally, a ship that has split, from its wing can **JOIN** that wing, becoming a wingmate again.

A ship's wing ID is used to indicate if a ship it acting as a wingmate or is flying independently. While a ship is a winmate, its wing ID is positioned beneath its ship card so the top of the ID card is showing.
If the ship has split from its wing, its wing ID is positioned beneath its ship card so the bottom of the ID card is showing.

As a ship splits from or joins its wing, players should adjust that ship's ID card to reflect the ship's current status within the wing.

## Forced Splitting

Many game effects can force a ship to split from its wing. A wingmate **must** split from its wing when any of the following occur.

- The ship cannot be placed into formation.
- The ship becomes ionized or tractored.
- The ship is stressed and its wing leader executes a red maneuver.
- An effect other than a maneuver instructs the ship to move or rotate its base.
- The wing leader is removed, or becomes ioized or tractored.

Due to forced splitting that occurs after the Planning Phase and before the Engagement Phase, it is possible that ship might not have a maneuver dial assigned to it for the Activation Phase. If a split ship does not have a dial assigned in the Activation Phase, it does not activate as normal. Instead, at the end of the Activation Phase, it **must** execute as [2 :straight:] maneuver, skip its Perfrom Action step, and gain one stress token.

## Voluntary Splitting

During the End Phase, a ship can voluntarily choose to split from its wing. During the next Planning Phase, the ship is assigned a dial that matches its ship type. It functions like a normal ship unless it chooses to join it wing again later.

## Joining

At the start of the Planning Phase, a split ship can join its wing if the following conditions are met.

- The ship is at range 0-1 of its previous wing leader.
- The ship is not stressed, ionized, tractored, or cloaked.

A ship can only join its previous wing, which is indicated by the ID card of that wing's leader. Afer joining the wing, the ship is placed back into its formation, it gains one stress token, and its maneuver dial is set aside.

# Placing Wings During Setup

During the Place Forces step of setup, the entire wing is placed immediately after the wing leader is placed at their initiative. Ships taht are part of a wing cannot be docked or placed in reserve unless a specific scenario dictates it.

Each wing must be placed in its wing position according to its wing ID card. Wing leaders are placed first as normal, and then each ship in the wing is placed in ascending order according to its ID number. Any ship that cannot be placed is split from the wing and must be placed within its deployment area and gains 1 stress token.

# Corner And Mini Wing Tools

Corrner and mini wing tools are provided because the full size wing tool may be too large for all battle situations. Players can use the medium or small wing tools when they are piloting wings in close proximity to oother ships.

When using these tools, players mst follow the smae rules as the full size wing tool. That is, each hip must align its center line with the lines on the tool, each ship's guides (front or rear) must be flush with the wing tool, and each wingmate's full front arc [:full-front-arc:] must face the same direction as the wing leader's full front arc [:full-front-arc:].

The corner tool works well for positioning wings that have lost one of their flanks. The mini wing tool can be used to position ships vertically or horizontally. When positioning two ships horizontally, the lines on the tool should be aligned with the center line of the ship's base.
