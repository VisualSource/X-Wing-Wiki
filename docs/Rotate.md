Pilots can rotate to alert a gunner or aim one of the ship's turret-mounted
armaments. When a ship performs the :rotate-arc: action, it rotates the turret arc
indicator to select any other standard [arc](/rules/Arc).

- If a ship rotates a double turret arc indicator, it must select the other two
  standard arcs it was not already selecting.
- If an ability instructs a ship to rotate its :single-turret-arc: indicator, this is different
  than performing a :rotate-arc: action. A ship that rotates its :single-turret-arc: indicator without
  performing the action can still perform a :rotate-arc: action this round.
- This is distinct from an ability that instructs a ship to "rotate your ship [a
  number of degrees]," which is described under [Rotate a Ship](/rules/Roate_A_Ship).
