## Buzz Droid Swarm

![Buzz Droid Swarm](Buzz_Droid_Swarm.webp)

**Types:** Device, Remote

**System, Activation, and End Phase:** No effect.

**Engagement Phase:** When you engage, each enemy ship at range 0 of the buzz droid swarm suffers 1 :critical-hit: damage. Other Rules: After an enemy ship overlaps or moves through a buzz droid swarm, the swarm's controlling player relocates it by aligning the tab to that ship's front or rear guides (this ship is at range 0 of the swarm).

The swarm cannot be aligned to a set of the ship's guides if doing so would cause it to overlap an object. If the swarm cannot be placed at a chosen set of guides, its controlling player must align it to the other set of the ship's guides.

If it cannot be aligned to the other set, the swarm and the enemy ship that overlapped or moved through it each suffer 1 :hit: damage.

## Sensor Buoy

**Types:** Device, Remote

Sensor buoys are remotes that come in pairs (one red, and one blue, each with its own remote card), and are placed by the **SENSOR BUOY SUITE** upgrade card. Beyond being remotes and interacting with that card, they have no additional rules.

## Dark Eye Probe Droid

**Types:** Device, Remote

**System Phase:** The DRK-1 probe droid's controlling player may choose a [2 :bank-left:], [2 :straight:], or [2 :bank-right:] template and any set of the DRK-1's guides. The player then relocates the remote, placing the DRK-1 at the other end of the template. It can be placed overlapping an object this way.

If the DRK-1 overlaps a ship, use the position marker to denote the ship's position, then place the ship on top of the remote.

**Activation, Engagement, and End Phase:** No effect.

**Other Rules:** While a ship locks an object or jams an enemy ship, it may measure range from a friendly DRK-1 probe droid. After an enemy ship executes a maneuver that causes it to overlap a DRK-1 probe droid, the ship's controller rolls 1 attack die. On a :focus: result, the DRK-1 probe droid suffers 1 :hit: damage.

## Commando Team

**Types:** Device, Remote.

When this device is dropped, it can be placed by sliding either its front or rear guides into the opposite end of the template.

**System and End Phase:** No effect.

**Activation Phase:** At the start of this phase, the commando team's controlling player may choose a [1 :left-turn:], [2 :straight:], or [1 :right-turn:] template and place it in the commando team's front guides. The player then relocates the remote forward, placing the commando team's rear guides at the other end of the template. The commando team can be placed overlapping an object in this way. If multiple players have commando teams, player order is used to determine the sequence (similar to ships). If the commando team overlaps a ship, use the position marker to denote the ship's position, then place the ship on top of the remote.

**Engagement Phase:** You cannot attack if there are enemy ships at range

0. Your primary attack is a range 1-2 :range-bonus-indicator: attack. To perform an attack you must spend 1 :charge:. While you perform an attack, you may change 1 :focus: result to a :hit: result.

**Other Rules:** After an enemy ship overlaps a commando team, that ship gains 1 strain token. After a commando team is placed while being dropped or relocating, if it is placed underneath one or more enemy ships, those ships each gain 1 strain token.

## Tracking Torpedoes

![Tracking Torpedoes](Tracking_Torpedoes.webp)

**Types:** Device, Remote

**System Phase:** At this remote's initiative, its controlling player relocates this remote forward using the [3 :bank-left:], [3 :bank-right:], or [4 :straight:] template.

**Activation Phase:** No effect. Engagement Phase: At this remote's initiative, if an object on which it has a lock is in its :front-arc: at range 0-1, this remote detonates.

**End Phase:** During the End Phase, if this remote does not have a lock on any object, this remote must acquire a lock on an object in its

:front-arc: at range 1-3, if able.

**Other Rules:** After this remote is destroyed, roll 1 attack die. On a :hit: or :critical-hit: result, this remote detonates.

When this remote detonates, each ship, remote, and structure at range 0 or in its :front-arc: at range 1 rolls 4 attack dice and suffers 1 damage for each matching :hit: and :critical-hit: result.
