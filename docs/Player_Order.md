Player order is used as a tiebreaker for many game effects. If players are instructed to resolve an effect in **PLAYER ORDER**, the first player resolves all of their effects first, then the second player resolves all of their effects.

During the Determine First Player step of [setup](/rules/Setup), the first player is assigned the First Player marker. The First Player marker is passed to the First Player every round, after rolling to determine player order in the Planning Phase.

- During the [System](/rules/System_Phase), [Activation](/rules/Activation_Phase), and [Engagement](/rules/Engagement_Phase) Phases, player order is
  used as a tiebreaker after [initiative](/rules/Initiative).
- When playing with more than two players, player order is determined for all players involved. All players roll to determine the first player, as normal. Then the remaining players roll to determine the second player. This continues until all player order has been established.
