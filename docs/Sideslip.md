A sideslip is an advanced maneuver using a turn (:left-turn: or :right-turn:) or bank (:bank-left: or :bank-right:)
template. A sideslip is executed by performing the following steps:

> A [2 Left Bank] Sideslip

1.  Place the narrow end of the template
    flush with the ship's side.

    - For a **left (:left-turn: or :bank-left:) sideslip**,
      place the template on the **right
      side** of the ship.
    - For a **right (:right-turn: or :bank-right:) sideslip**,
      place it on the **left side** of the ship.

    Align the center line of the template to the center hashmark of the base.
    The other end of the template must be in the ship's :full-front-arc:.

2.  Pick the ship up and place it at the other end of the template. Align the
    center hashmark on the opposite side of the ship to the center line of the
    template.

Additionally:

- A sideslip is executed by placing the maneuver template in the same
  orientation that it would be placed in front of the ship, but placing it at the
  center line of the ship instead. This means that a sideslip that moves a
  ship to the right is dialed in for the left maneuver and uses the left (:left-turn: or :bank-left:) template, and vice-versa.

- If the ship cannot fully execute a sideslip, it partially executes that
  maneuver using the left/right center line of the ship base (instead of the
  front/rear center line of the ship base, as it would normally) to determine
  its final position.

The sideslip changes the **placement** of the template, but the template's is **not** flipped over to the opposite direction.
