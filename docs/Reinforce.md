Pilots can reinforce to angle their deflector shields and increase the defensiveness of a portion of their ship. When a ship performs the :reinforce: action, it gains a reinforce token with either the fore or aft side faceup.

A ship is **REINFORCED** while it has a reinforce token assigned to it. Reinforce tokens are circular, green tokens. While a reinforced ship defends, if the attacker is inside the full arc specified by the reinforce token and not in the other full arc, the token provides an effect.

> Aft Reinforce

The attacker needs to be in the defender's :full-front-arc: arc for the fore reinforce token or be in the defender's :full-rear-arc: arc for the aft reinforce token.

![Example](Reinforce_Example.webp)

> In this example, since the VT-49 Decimator has a fore reinforce token, the effect would only apply while defending against the one X-wing in front of it.

During the Neutralize Results step, if the [attack](/rules/Attack) would [hit](/rules/Hit) and there is more
than one :hit:/:critical-hit:> result remaining, one :evade: result is added to cancel one result.

- A ship can have more than one reinforce token. If a ship has multiple of the same type of reinforce token, their effects are applied one at a time. Thus, for two reinforce tokens to both apply their effect, there would need to be at least three :hit:/:critical-hit:> results remaining.
- When a ship gains a reinforce token, unless specified otherwise, the player that controls that ship chooses whether it gains a fore reinforce token or an aft reinforce token.
- A ship does not spend the reinforce token when resolving its effect.
- If an ability instructs a ship to gain one reinforce token, this is different than performing a :reinforce: action. A ship that gains the token without performing the action can still perform the :reinforce: action this round.
- Reinforce can be used against attacks at range 4-5 even the defender's :full-front-arc: or :full-rear-arc: normally only extends to range 3. If the attacker is at range 4-5, treat the defender's :full-front-arc: or :full-rear-arc: arc as extending to range 5 for the purposes of determining which arc the defender is in for reinforce (but not for any other effects or abilities).
