Each [maneuver](/rules/Maneuver) has three components: [speed](/rules/Speed) (a number 0-5), [difficulty](/rules/Difficulty) (red, white, or blue), and bearing (an arrow or other symbol). Each bearing is also defined with a **DIRECTION**, including straight, left, or right.

All maneuvers are categorized as either basic or advanced. Additionally, all maneuvers that begin by using the front [guides](/rules/Guides) are **FORWARD** maneuvers.

### Basic Manuvers

The following bearings are for **BASIC MANEUVERS**. These maneuvers follow the standard rules for executing a maneuver.

- **Straight:** The :straight: (straight) bearing advances a ship straight forward.
- **Bank:** The :bank-left: (left bank) and :bank-right: (right bank) bearings advance a ship at a shallow curve to one side, changing its facing by 45º.
- **Turn:** The :left-turn: (left turn) and :right-turn: (right turn) bearings advance a ship at a tight curve to one side, changing its facing by 90º.

### Advanced Maneuvers

The following bearings are for **ADVANCED MANEUVERS**. These have exceptions to the standard rules for executing a maneuver.

- **Koiogran Turn:** The :koiogran-turn: (Koiogran turn) bearing advances a ship straight forward, changing its facing by 180º. This uses the same template as the :straight: maneuver. + If the ship fully executes the maneuver, the player slides the ship's front guides into the end of the template instead of the rear guides.
- **Segnor's Loop:** The :segnor-left: (left Segnor's Loop) and :segnor-right: (right Segnor's Loop) bearings advance a ship at a shallow curve to one side, then reverses its facing. This uses the same template as the :bank-left: and :bank-right: maneuvers. + If the ship fully executes the maneuver, the player slides the ship's front guides into the end of the template instead of the rear guides.
- **Tallon Roll:** The :tallon-left: (left Tallon Roll) and :tallon-right: (right Tallon Roll) bearings advance a ship at a tight curve to one side, sharply changing its facing by 180º. This uses the same template as the :left-turn: and :right-turn: maneuvers. + If the ship fully executes the maneuver, before the player places the ship at the opposite end of the template, the ship is rotated 90º to the left for a :tallon-left:, or 90º to the right for a :tallon-right:. Then the player places the ship with the hashmark on the side of the base aligned to the left, middle, or right of the end of the template, (similar to a [barrel roll](/rules/Barrel_Roll)).

If a ship overlaps another ship while executing a Koiogran turn, Segnor's Loop, or Tallon Roll, the ship partially executes the maneuver by using the rear guides as though it was executing the basic maneuver that uses the same template.

- **Stationary:** The :stationary: (stationary) bearing does not move the ship from its current position. This bearing does not have a corresponding template. 
  + A ship that executes this maneuver counts as executing a maneuver, does not overlap any ships, does trigger the effects of overlapping any obstacles at range 0, and continues to be at range 0 of any objects it was touching before executing this maneuver. 
  + Stationary maneuvers are not forward maneuvers. 
  + A ship that executes a stationary maneuver always fully executes the maneuver. At the start of any type of **REVERSE** maneuver, instead of sliding the template between the front guides of the ship's base, slide it between the rear guides. Additionally, when the ship is moved, the player slides the ship's front guides into the end of the template instead of the rear guides.
- **Reverse Straight:** The :r-straight: (reverse straight) bearing moves the ship straight backward. This bearing uses the same template as the :straight: maneuver.
  + Reverse straight maneuvers are reverse maneuvers, not forward maneuvers.
- **Reverse Bank:** The :r-bank-left: ( left reverse bank) and :r-bank-right (right reverse bank) bearing moves the ship at a shallow curve to one side, changing its facing by 45º. This bearing uses the same template as the :bank-left: and :bank-right: maneuvers. 
  + Reverse bank maneuvers are reverse maneuvers, not forward maneuvers.
