A ship flees if any part of its base is outside the [play area](/rules/Play_Area) at any time. A ship that flees is [removed from the game](/rules/Removed_From_Game).

- While a ship [moves](/rules/Move), the ship does not flee if only the template is outside the play area.
- Before a fleeing ship is removed from the game, the only effects it resolves before being removed from the game are effects that trigger when it flees.
- A ship cannot flee while resolving a [boost](/rules/Boost), [barrel roll](/rules/Barrel_Roll), [decloak](/rules/Cloak), or [SLAM](/rules/Slam).
- [Partially executing](/rules/Partially_Executing) a maneuver can cause a ship to flee if any part of its base is outside the play area after the maneuver.
