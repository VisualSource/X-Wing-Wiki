Some of the text on condition, damage, ship, and upgrade cards describe **ABILITIES**. These abilities consist of a timing and an effect.

- Unless a card ability uses the word “may” or has the “**Action:**” or “**Attack:**” headers, the ability is mandatory and must be resolved.

- A ship cannot spend or remove tokens that belong to another ship unless an effect explicitly states otherwise. Similarly, a ship cannot spend, modify, or remove die results that belong to another ship unless an effect explicitly states otherwise.

- If multiple abilities resolve at the same time, the players use the [ability queue](/rules/Ability_Queue) to determine the order in which the abilities resolve.

- A [destroyed](/rules/Destroying_Ships) ship's abilities remain active until that ship is removed unless the ability specifies a different timing for the effect to end, such as “until the end of the Engagement Phase.” Such effects remain active until the end of the specified time.

## Pilot and Ship Abilities

Some ship cards have abilities in addition to or instead of flavor text. All [limited](/rules/Limited) ships have unique, personalized **PILOT ABILITIES** instead of flavor text. Some ships have **SHIIP ABILITIES** on their ship cards listed below their pilot ability or flavor text. Ships of the same ship type all have the same ship ability.

## Replacement Effects

Some abilities are substitutive in nature—they replace how an effect would normally resolve. These abilities use the words “would” and “instead."

- Replacement effects are not added to the end of the [ability queue](/rules/Ability_Queue) as they
  are resolved at the timing of the effect they are replacing.
- When a replacement effect resolves, the replaced effect is treated as
  having not occurred.

  - For example, Jyn Erso's ability says “If a friendly ship at range 0-3
    would gain a focus token, it may gain 1 evade token instead.” If this
    ability is used, an effect that triggers after a ship gains a focus token
    cannot trigger.

- If there are multiple replacement effects that could substitute for the
  same effect, only one effect can be substituted for the original effect.

  - For example, a ship is about to gain a focus token and has both the
    ability “Before you would gain a focus token, gain an evade token
    instead” and the ability “Before you would gain a focus token, gain a
    calculate token instead.” Only one of those abilities could be resolved.

## Paying Costs

A ship can pay a cost for an effect only if the effect can be resolved.

- For example, GNK “Gonk” Droid's ability says “Action: Spend 1 :charge: to
  recover 1 shield.” The ship cannot spend the charge if it has no inactive
  shields.
- Replacement effects can replace a cost that a ship would pay for an
  effect. If a cost is replaced in this way, the effect is still resolved.
