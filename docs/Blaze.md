After this obstacle is placed, place a fuse marker on it.

- During the End Phase, remove each Blaze with no fuse markers, then remove one fuse marker from each Blaze.

While a ship moves, if it moves through or overlaps a Blaze obstacle, it suffers the following effect:

- After the move is resolved, roll one attack die. On a :hit: or :critical-hit: result, the ship suffers one :hit: damage; on a :focus: result, it gains one stress token. Then the ship skips its Perform Action step this round.

After a remote relocates, if it relocates so that it at range 0 of a Blaze obstacle, it suffers one :hit: damage.

While a unit defends, if the attack is obstructed by a Blaze, it rolls 1 additional defense die
