Pilots can reload to rearm ordnance tubes by moving around ammo on their ship. When a ship performs the :reload: action, it reloads by performing the following steps:

1. Choose one of the ship's equipped :torpedo:, :missile:, or :device: upgrade cards that has fewer active :charge: than its charge limit.
2. That card recovers one :charge:.
3. The ship gains one [disarm](/rules/Disarm) token.

Additionally:

- If an ability instructs a player to reload, this is different than performing a :reload: action. A ship that reloads without performing the action can still perform the :reload: action this round.
