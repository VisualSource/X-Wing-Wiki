desc: Linked actions allow a ship to perform an action after performing another action.

Linked actions allow a ship to perform an [action](/rules/Action) after performing another action. Linked actions can appear on a ship or upgrade card in the linked action bar just to the right of the action bar. After the ship performs the action from its action bar, it can perform the attached action listed on the linked action bar.

- After a ship performs an action with an attached linked action, if the player wants to resolve the linked action, it is added to the [ability queue](/rules/Ability_Queue). If it has multiple actions linked from the same starting action (e.g. :focus: :linked: :barrel-roll: and :focus: :linked: :boost: ), it can choose only one linked action to add to the queue.

- A linked action can be performed after performing the action it is attached to even if that action was granted by a card effect or other game effect.

- After a ship performs a linked action, it cannot use that action to add another linked action to the ability queue. For example, if a ship has both :focus: :linked: :barrel-roll:  and :barrel-roll: :linked: :evade: on its action bar, it cannot use the :barrel-roll: action from its linked action bar (attached to :focus:) as the :barrel-roll: action on its action bar to perform a linked :evade: action.
