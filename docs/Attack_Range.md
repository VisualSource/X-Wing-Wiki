During an attack, the **ATTACK RANGE** is determined by measuring [range](/rules/Range) from the closest point of the attacker to the closest point of the defender that is in the [attack arc](/rules/Attack_Arc).

- While measuring range for abilities that do not specify the attack range, the range between the attacker and defender is measured from the closest point of the attacker to the closest point of the defender, ignoring the attack arc.

- While attacking a ship at range 0, the attack range is always 0.
