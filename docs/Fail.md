Some effects can **FAIL**, which means the effect did not resolve as intended and instead is resolved in a default way.

- A ship can fail when it [barrel rolls](/rules/Barrel_Roll), [boosts](/rules/Boost), [coordinates](/rules/Coordinate), [decloaks](/rules/Cloak), [deploys](/rules/Deploy), [jams](/rules/Jam), [locks](/rules/Lock), or [SLAMs](/rules/SLAM).
- An effect that fails does not trigger any effects that would occur after a ship resolves that effect.
- If an action fails, the player does not choose a different action to perform and cannot choose to resolve the effect in a different way.
- If an action fails, since the action was not completed, that ship cannot perform a [linked action](/rules/Linked_Action).
- After a red action fails, the ship gains a [stress](/rules/Stress) token.
