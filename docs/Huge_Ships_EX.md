This section contains diagrams for huge ships.

## EXAMPLE OF A [2 :bank-right:] MANEUVER

This example shows how a huge ship executes a bank maneuver.

## EXAMPLE OF OVERLAPPING A HUGE SHIP

This example shows how a huge ship overlap of another huge ship is resolved.

>  Fig. 2a: The Raider-class corvette is attempting to execute a [2 :bank-right: ] maneuver

![Raider overlap CR9](HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_2B.webp)

> ig. 2b: The Raider-class corvette would overlap the CR90 corvette.

![Overlap resolved](HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_2C.webp)

> Fig. 2c: To resolve this, the Raider instead executes a [1 :bank-right:] maneuver, since it is a speed 1 lower maneuver that does not cause it to overlap the CR90

## EXAMPLE OF OVERLAPPING A STANDARD SHIP

This example shows how a huge ship overlap of a standard ship is resolved.

![Overlap resolved](HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_3A.webp)

> Fig. 3a: The Raider-class corvette would overlap the YT-1300. To resolve this, the YT-1300's player picks it up and sets it aside.

![Overlap resolved](HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_3B.webp)

> Fig. 3b: After the Raider moves, the YT-1300's player places it in the Raider's full rear arc [:full-rear-arc:] at range 0-1. Then a chosen opponent may rotate the YT-1300 by 90 ÌŠ.

## EXAMPLE OF TRACKING :single-turret-arc: ON A HUGE SHIP

This CR90 has a Point-Defense Battery [:hardpoint:] equipped, so a :double-turret-arc: turret arc indicator needs to be placed on a mount. A black indicator is selected and placed on the front mount.

![Overlap resolved](HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_4A.webp)

> Since the black :double-turret-arc: was used on the front mount, the corresponding black :double-turret-arc: mount marker is placed on the Point-Defense Battery upgrade card

![Overlap resolved](HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_4B.webp)

> This CR90 also has a Turbolaser Battery [:hardpoint:] equipped. Since a black turret arc indicator was used on the front mount, the white :single-turret-arc: is used for the rear mount.

![Overlap resolved](HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_4C.webp)

> Additionally, the corresponding white :single-turret-arc: mount marker is placed on the Turbolaser Battery upgrade card.

## EXAMPLE OF A HUGE SHIP WITH MULTIPLE :single-turret-arc:

This CR90 has a Point-Defense Battery [:hardpoint:] and a Turbolaser Battery [:hardpoint:] equipped. The Point-Defense Battery's black :double-turret-arc: turret arc indicator was place on the front mount and the Turbolaser Battery's white :single-turret-arc: turret arc indicator was place on the rear mount.

![Overlap resolved](HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_5A.webp)

> The Point-Defense Battery can attack from the CR90's :left-arc: and :right-arc:. The Turbolaser Battery can attack from the CR90's :front-arc:.

![Overlap resolved](HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_5B.webp)

> If the CR90 tried to attack this TIE fighter, the attack range for the Turbolaser Battery would be range 1, which is too close, but the range for both the Point-Defense Battery and its primary weapon is range 2.
