Pilots can calculate, using advanced computing power to increase their combat performance. When a ship performs the :calculate: action, it gains one calculate token. A ship is **CALCULATING** while it has at least one calculate token. Calculate tokens are circular, green tokens. A calculating ship follows these rules:

- While a calculating ship performs an attack, during the Modify Attack Dice
  step, it may spend one or more calculate tokens to change that many of
  its :focus: results to :hit: results.

- While a calculating ships defends, during the Modify Defense Dice step, it
  may spend one or more calculate tokens to change that many of its :focus:
  Additionally:

- A ship cannot spend calculate tokens to change :focus: results to :evade: or :hit:
  results if it does not have any :focus: results.
- If a card ability instructs a ship to gain a calculate token, this is different
  than performing a :calculate: action. A ship that gains the token without
  performing the action can still perform the :calculate: action this round.
