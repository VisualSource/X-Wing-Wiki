A ship is **STRESSED** while it has at least one stress token. A stressed ship cannot execute red [maneuvers](/rules/Maneuver) or perform [actions](/rules/Action). The stress token is a red [token](/rules/Tokens).

- A ship receives one stress token while it executes a red maneuver or after it performs a red action. Additionally, a ship removes one stress token while it executes a blue maneuver.
- If a stressed ship attempts to execute a red maneuver, it instead executes a white [2 :straight:] maneuver. + After a stressed ship reveals a red maneuver, abilities that change the maneuver can be used. After resolving these abilities, if the ship would still execute a red maneuver, it instead executes a white [2 :straight:] maneuver.
- Huge ships have additional rules for stress (see [Appendix: Huge Ships](/rules/Huge_Ships)).
