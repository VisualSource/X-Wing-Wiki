A ship is **IONIZED** while it has a number of ion tokens relative to
its [size](/article/Size): one or more for a small ship, two or more for a medium
ship, and three or more for a large ship. Ion tokens are red
[tokens](/article/Tokens).

A ship that is ionized cannot acquire or maintain locks. When a ship becomes
ionized, it breaks all locks it is maintaining.
During the [Activation Phase](/article/Activation_Phase), an ionized ship activates as follows:

1. The ionized ship reveals its dial as normal.
2. During the Execute Maneuver step, the ionized ship executes an **ION MANEUVER**
   with the same direction shown on its dial. An ion maneuver
   is a blue speed 1 bank or straight [<LeftBank/>, <Straight/>, <RightBank/>] [maneuver](/article/Maneuver).

- If an ionized ship's dial shows a stop [<Stationary/>] maneuver, they perform their ion
  maneuver as a [1 <Straight/>] maneuver.
- The [bearing](/article/Bearing), [difficulty](/article/Difficulty), and [speed](/article/Speed) of this maneuver cannot be changed
  unless an ability explicitly affects the ion maneuver.

3. During the Perform Action step, the ship can perform only the <Focus/> action.
4. At the end of a ship's activation, if it executed an ion maneuver, it removes
   all of its ion tokens.

Additionally:

- An ionized ship cannot perform any action except the <Focus/> action.
- Ships cannot use abilities that trigger from an ionized ship revealing its
  dial.
- If a ship that was ionized during the Planning Phase is no longer ionized at
  the beginning of its activation, it activates as normal.
