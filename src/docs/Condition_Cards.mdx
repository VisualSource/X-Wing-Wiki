<Header title="condition cards" version="1.4.4" />

Condition cards are cards assigned by ship and upgrade cards that represent
persistent game effects. A condition card is not in play until a game effect
assigns it to a ship. When a condition card is assigned, its text resolves.

After a ship is assigned a condition card, assign the associated condition
marker to that ship as a reminder of the card's persistent effect.

- A condition marker is removed when the corresponding condition card is removed.
- A condition that has been removed can be assigned again.
- When a ship is [removed from the game](/article/Removed_From_The_Game), any condition cards assigned to that ship are not removed.

### Limited conditions

Some condition cards are [limited](/article/limited), meaning that each player can have a limited
number of instances of that condition in play. If an effect assigns a new
instance of a limited condition in excess of the limited value of that condition
for that player, the player whose effect caused the condition to be assigned
chooses one instance of the limited condition in play and removes it, then
assigns the new instance of that condition.

For example, if a condition is limited 1 and a second instance would be
assigned for that player, the first instance of the condition card is removed
and then the second is assigned.

### Secret Conditions

Condition cards that share the same condition marker and are assigned
facedown, rather than faceup, are called **SECRET CONDITIONS**. A secret
condition is assigned by one player, and the other players do not know which
of the secret conditions that shares the same marker was assigned. They are
revealed when their effects are resolved. Additionally:

- No ship can have more than one secret condition that shares the same
  condition marker.

- If a ship is assigned a secret condition that uses the same condition
  marker as a condition it already has, the previous condition is removed (if
  it was facedown, do not reveal it).

- The player whose effect assigned the condition may look at the facedown
  condition at any time.

- The identity of the assigned secret condition, as well as any unassigned
  secret conditions that share the same condition marker, are hidden
  information from all other players.

- The text of secret conditions is open information that can be accessed by
  either player at any time. Products that include secret conditions include an
  extra copy of each of the secret conditions, so that all players can reference
  the text of the conditions without revealing which condition is in play.
