The dials included in the first printing of the **Tantive IV** expansion are incorrect. The incorrect dials can be identified by the "RDR" text printed in the center (instead of the correct "C90.") The correct dial is as follows:

> Correct CR90 Dial
![Correct CR90 Dail](DIAL_CORRECT_CR90.webp)

> Correct CR90 Manuver Chart
![Correct CR90 Maneuver Chart](Correct_Maneuver_Chart_CR90.webp)

Additionally, the ship can still be played using the incorrect dial if necessary.
by following these steps:

- Step 1: Using the incorrect dial, select a maneuver.
- Step 2: When revealing the dial, consult the corrected chart or dial

included above. If the difficulty of the maneuver differs, use the difficulty on the corrected dial instead. Because the speed and bearing of all maneuvers on the incorrect dial still match with the CR90's correct maneuver dial, any maneuver on the dial is still a legal speed and bearing for the CR90. Additionally, the incorrect dial is not missing any speed/bearing combinations available to the CR90.

Note also that effects that refer to the ship's revealed maneuver use the corrected difficulty.
