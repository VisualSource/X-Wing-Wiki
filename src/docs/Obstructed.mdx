<Header title="obstructed"/>

An [attack](/article/Attack) is **OBSTRUCTED** if the attacker measures [range](/article/Range) through an object. If
a ship or [device](/article/Device) obstructs an attack, there is no inherent effect. If an [obstacle](/article/Obstacle)
obstructs an attack, there is an additional effect.

* If at least one obstacle obstructs an attack, the defender rolls one additional
defense die during the Roll Defense Dice step.

* The attacker measures from the closest point of its base to the closest
point of the defender's base that is in the [attack arc](/article/Arc), therefore the
attacker cannot measure range from or to another point in order to avoid
measuring through an object.

    + If multiple points are at equal distance from the attacker (for example,
    if the attacker and defender are parallel), the attacker chooses one of
    those lines for measuring range from or to another point in order to
    avoid measuring through an object.. In the example, the X-wing can
    choose to make this attack be obstructed or not.
