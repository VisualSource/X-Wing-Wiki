<Header title="Planning Phase"/>

The Planning Phase is the first phase of the [round](/article/Round). During the Planning Phase,
each player secretly sets a [maneuver](/article/Maneuver) for each of their ships. To set a ship's
maneuver, the player takes a [dial](/article/Dial) matching the ship's type and rotates the
dial until the arrow points at the desired maneuver. Then the dial is placed
facedown in the play area next to the matching ship. After all ships have dials
assigned to them, players roll to determine player order as follows:

<ol>
    1. Each player rolls three attack dice. The player with the most <Crit/> results
    is the first player.
    1. In the case of a tie, the first player is the player with the most <Focus/>
    results.
    1. If there is still a tie, the first player is the player with the most <Hit/>
    results.
    1. If there is still a tie, players reroll the dice and follow the above rules
    until the tie is broken.
</ol>

* This roll cannot be modified by game effects.
After player order has been determined, play proceeds to the [System Phase](/article/System_Phase).
* The phase ends after players roll to determine player order.
* Players can assign their dials in any order.
* Players are allowed to change their selections on their dials until the
players have rolled to determine player order.
* A player must inform their opponent if they wish to touch or look at one of
their dials during the System or [Activation Phase](/article/Activation_Phase).
* If a player forgets to set a maneuver dial for a ship during the Planning
Phase, during its activation the ship gains a stress token, then performs a
**STRESS MANEUVER**. The **STRESS MANEUVER** is a white [<Straight/> 2] maneuver.
