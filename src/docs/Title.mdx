<Header title="Title" icon={<Title />} />

A title is a type of [upgrade](/article/Upgrade_Cards) that is used to represent a very specific version of
a ship. Therefore, each title is restricted to a specific [ship type](/article/Ship_Type). For example,
the Millennium Falcon is a <Title/> upgrade.
