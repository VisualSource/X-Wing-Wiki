<Header title="mine" />

A mine is a type of [device](/article/Device) that is placed in the [play area](/article/Play_Area) through a card effect
from a <Device/> upgrade card. The upgrade card that corresponds to the mine has
the “Mine” trait at the top of its card text. Mines can be [dropped](/article/Deploy) or [launched](/article/Deploy)
during the System Phase and typically detonate after they are [moved through](/article/Move)
or [overlapped](/article/Overlap) by a ship.
