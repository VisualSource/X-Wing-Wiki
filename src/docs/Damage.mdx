Damage represents the amount of structural damage a ship can take.
Damage is tracked by damage cards. A ship is destroyed when the number of
damage cards it has is equal to or greater than its [hull](/article/Hull) value.

There are two types of damage: <Hit/> (regular) damage and <Crit/> (critical)
damage. When a ship suffers damage, that damage is suffered one at a time.
For each damage a ship suffers, it loses an <Shield/> (active shield). If it does not
have an <Shield/> remaining, it is dealt a damage card instead. For <Hit/> damage, the
card is dealt **facedown**; for <Crit/> damage, the card is dealt **faceup** and its
text is resolved. All <Hit/> damage is suffered **before** <Crit/> damage.

A ship is **DAMAGED** while it has at least one damage card. A ship is
**CRITICALLY DAMAGED** while it has at least one faceup damage card.

* If an effect instructs a player to deal a damage card to a ship, this is
different from the ship suffering damage. The card is dealt to the ship
regardless of whether the ship has any <Shield/> (active shields).
* When a ship suffers damage or otherwise is dealt damage cards that would
cause it to exceed its [hull](/article/Hull) value, the excess damage cards are still dealt.
