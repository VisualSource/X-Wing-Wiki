If a card instructs a ship to perform a bonus attack, it performs an additional [attack](/rules/Attack) during the Aftermath step.

- A few [special weapons](/rules/Special_Weapon) provide a bonus attack using the same weapon.
  While performing this type of bonus attack, the same arc requirements,
  range requirements, and cost requirements are followed unless stated
  otherwise.
      +  For example, a ship that attacked with the Cluster Missiles card can

  perform a bonus attack against another ship at range 1 of the defender
  and ignore the :lock: requirement. The range (1-2), arc (:front-arc:), and cost
  (spending 1 :charge: charge) are maintained for the bonus attack.

- A ship can perform only one bonus attack per [round](/rules/Round).

- If both players have a bonus attack that triggers after an attack, the
  defending player resolves their bonus attack first.
- Huge ships have further rules for bonus attacks. See [Appendix: Huge Ships](/rules/Huge_Ships).
