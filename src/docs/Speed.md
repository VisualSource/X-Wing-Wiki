Each maneuver has three components: speed (a number 0-5), difficulty (red, white, or blue), and bearing (an arrow or other symbol).

- If the speed of a maneuver is increased or decreased, the speed of the maneuver is restricted to the templates that exist. + For example, the speed of a [3 :segnor-right:] cannot be increased and the speed of a [1 :straight:>] cannot be decreased.
- The speed of a [0 :stationary:] cannot be increased or decreased.
- Even if a ship partially executes a maneuver, it is still treated as having executed a maneuver of the indicated speed.
