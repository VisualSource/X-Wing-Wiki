<Header title="deficit" version="1.4.4" />

If the squad point total of a player's squad is less than the maximum allowed
squad value, subtract the total squad point value of their squad from the
maximum to determine that player's deficit before the game begins.

- At the start of the game, each player earns mission points equal to
  their opponent's deficit.
