## Bomblet

<ImgCenter src="/images/Bomblet.webp" alt="Bomblet" />

**Types:** Device, Bomb

At the end of the Activation Phase, this device detonates.
When this device detonates, each ship and remote at range 0-1
rolls 2 attack dice. Each ship or remote suffers 1 <Hit/> damage for
each <Hit/>/<Crit/> result.

## Concussion Bomb

<ImgCenter src="/images/Concussion_Bomb.webp" alt="Concussion Bomb" />

**Types:** Device, Bomb

At the end of the Activation Phase, this device detonates.
When this device detonates, each ship and remote at range 0-1 is dealt
1 facedown damage card. Then, each ship at range 0-1 must expose 1
damage card unless it chooses to gain 1 strain token.

## Electro-Proton Bomb

<ImgCenter src="/images/Electoro_Proton_Bomb.webp" alt="Electro-Proton Bomb" />

**Types:** Device, Bomb

At the end of the Activation Phase, this device detonates.
When this device detonates, each ship and remote at range 0-2 rolls 4
attack dice. Each ship loses 1 shield for each blank result, gains
1 ion token for each <Focus/>/<Hit/> result, and gains 1 disarm token for each <Crit/>
result. Each remote at range 0-1 loses 1 shield for each blank result and
suffers 1 damage for each <Focus/>/<Hit/> result.

## Cluster Mine

<ImgCenter src="/images/Cluster_Mine.webp" alt="Cluster Mine" />

**Types:** Device, Mine

A Cluster Mine Set consists of 3 individual Cluster Mine devices.
When a Cluster Mines set is placed, the center Cluster Mine is placed as
normal, then two additional Cluster Mines are placed in the recesses as shown.
After a ship overlaps or moves through any individual Cluster Mine, it
detonates. Other Cluster Mines in the set that were not overlapped or
moved through do not detonate.
When each of these devices detonates, that ship rolls 2 attack dice. That
ship then suffers 1 <Hit/>/<Crit/> damage for each matching result.

## Conner Net

<ImgCenter src="/images/Conner_Net.webp" alt="Conner Net" />

**Types:** Device, Mine

After a ship overlaps or moves through this device, it detonates.
When this device detonates, the ship suffers
1 <Hit/> damage and gains 3 ion tokens.

## Ion Bomb

<ImgCenter src="/images/Ion_Bomb.webp" alt="Ion Bomb" />

**Types:** Device, Bomb

At the end of the Activation Phase, this device detonates.
When this device detonates, each ship at range 0-1 gains 3 ion tokens,
and each remote at range 0-1 suffers 1 <Hit/> damage.

## Proton Bomb

<ImgCenter src="/images/Proton_Bomb.webp" alt="Proton Bomb" />

**Types:** Device, Bomb

At the end of the Activation Phase, this device detonates.
When this device detonates, each ship and remote at range 0-1
suffers 1 <Crit/> damage.

## Seismic Charge

<ImgCenter src="/images/Seismic_Charge.webp" alt="Seismic Charge" />

**Types:** Device, Bomb

At the end of the Activation Phase, this device detonates.
When this device detonates, choose 1 obstacle at range 0-1. Each ship
and remote at range 0-1 of the obstacle suffers 1 <Hit/> damage. Then
remove that obstacle.

## Proximity Mine

<ImgCenter src="/images/Proximity_Mine.webp" alt="Proximity Mine" />

**Types:** Device, Mine

After a ship overlaps or moves through this device, it detonates.
When this device detonates, that ship rolls 2 attack dice. That ship then
suffers 1 <Hit/> damage plus 1 <Hit/>/<Crit/> damage for each matching result.

## Thermal Detonator

<ImgCenter src="/images/Thermal_Detonator.webp" alt="Thermal Detonator" />

**Types:** Device, Bomb

At the end of the Activation Phase, this device detonates.
When this device detonates, each ship and remote at range 0-1 rolls 1
attack die. Each ship gains 1 strain token for each <Focus/> result, and each
ship and remote suffers 1 <Hit/>/<Crit/> damage for each matching result.

## Blazer Bomb

**Types:** Device, Bomb.

<DoubleCenter

  altA="Blazer Bomb"
  altB="Blaze"
  textA="Blazer Bomb"
  textB="Blaze"
/>

At the end of the Activation Phase, this device detonates.

When this device detonates, each ship and remote at range 0-1 rolls 1
attack die. Each ship or remote suffers
1 <Hit/> damage for each <Hit/>/<Crit/> result.

After this device detonates, place a Blaze by aligning the Blaze's guides to
the device's tab.

See [Blase](/article/Blase)

<ImgCenter src="/images/Blazer_Bomb_Guides.webp" alt="Blazer Bomb Guides" />
<TextCenter text="Placing Blaze (aligning its guides to Blazer Bomb tab)." />

A Blaze is an obstacle. After this obstacle is placed, place a fuse marker
on it.
During the End Phase, remove each Blaze with no fuse markers, then remove
one fuse marker from each Blaze.
