Each ship type has its own unique dial. All
expansion products contain a dial for each
ship in that product. Dials are used during the
[Planning Phase](/article/Planning_Phase) to secretly select maneuvers.

* When a player is instructed to set a
ship's dial, the player can choose the
same maneuver that it already has
selected unless stated otherwise.
* Players are not allowed to touch or look at their opponents' facedown
dials. If a player wishes to touch or look at their own facedown dial, they
must inform their opponent they wish to do so before touching the dial.
* Each [faction](/article/Faction) has its own
Maneuver Dial Upgrade Kit. These dials
assemble slightly differently than the standard dials and use a curved
indicator below the [maneuver](/article/Maneuver) instead to indicate selected maneuvers.
