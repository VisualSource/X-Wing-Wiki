<Header title="speed"/>

Each maneuver has three components: speed (a number 0-5), difficulty (red,
white, or blue), and bearing (an arrow or other symbol).

* If the speed of a maneuver is increased or decreased, the speed of the
maneuver is restricted to the templates that exist.
    + For example, the speed of a [3 <SegnorRight/>] cannot be increased and the speed of
    a [1 <Straight/>] cannot be decreased.
* The speed of a [0 <Stationary/>] cannot be increased or decreased.
* Even if a ship partially executes a maneuver, it is still treated as having
executed a maneuver of the indicated speed.
