Ships can lock to use their computer to acquire targeting data on
environmental hazards or other ships. When a ship performs a <Lock/> action, it
acquires a lock. A **LOCKING** ship is a ship that is attempting to acquire a lock
by performing the following steps:

1. Measure range from the locking ship to any number of [objects](/article/Objects).
2. Choose another object at [range](/article/Range) 0-3.
3. Assign a lock token to it with the number matching the [ID marker](/article/Id_Marker) of the
   locking ship.

An object is **LOCKED** while it has at least one lock token assigned to it. Lock
tokens are red tokens. While a ship has another ship locked, it follows this rule:

- During the Modify Attack Dice step of a ship's [attack](/article/Attack), it can spend a lock
  token that it has on the defender to reroll one or more of its attack dice.
  Additionally:
- When a ship is instructed to **BREAK** a lock it has, the lock token
  corresponding to its ID token is removed.
- While acquiring a lock, it [fails](/article/Fail) only if there is no valid object to choose.
- A ship cannot acquire or have a lock on itself.
- An object can be locked by more than one ship.
- A ship can maintain only one lock. If a locking ship already has a lock,
  before the chosen object would be assigned a lock token, the ship's former
  lock token is removed.
- If an ability instructs a ship to acquire a lock, this is different than
  performing a <Lock/> action. A ship that acquires a lock without performing the
  action can still perform the <Lock/> action this round. + If a ship is instructed to acquire a lock, the object it locks must be at
  range 0-3 unless otherwise specified.
