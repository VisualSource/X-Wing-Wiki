A ship's agility is the green number on its ship card. This value
indicates the number of defense dice the ship rolls while it defends.

- During an [attack](/article/Attack), a ship with an agility value of “0” can still
  roll additional defense dice granted by game effects such as the [range bonus](/article/Range_Bouns)
  the attack being [obstructed](/article/Obstructed) by an [obstacle](/article/Obstacles), or other card [abilities](/article/Abilities).

- Abilities or game effects that cause a ship to roll additional or fewer
  defense dice do not modify the agility value of the defender.

- All modifiers to agility are cumulative.

- After all modifiers have been applied, if the number of defense dice
  required for a roll is less than “0,” it is treated as “0.”.

- After all modifiers have applied, if the number of defense dice required for
  a roll is greater than "6," it is treated as "6.".
