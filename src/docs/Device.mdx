Devices are objects that exist in the play area and are represented by
cardboard markers. Certain cards allow a ship to add a specific type of device
to the play area and provide additional rules for how that device behaves.
There are a number of ways for a device to enter or change location in the
play area. Some provide specific instructions for how to place a device in the
play area, while others use one or more of the following processes:

To **DROP** a device, follow the steps below:

1. Take the template indicated on the upgrade card.
2. Set the template between the ship's rear guides.
3. Place the device indicated on the upgrade card into the play area and
   slide the guides of the device into the opposite end of the template. Then
   remove the template.

To **LAUNCH** a device, follow the steps below:

1. Take the template indicated on the upgrade card.
2. Set the template between the ship's front [guides](/article/Guides).
3. Place the device indicated on the upgrade card into the play area and
   slide the guides of the device into the opposite end of the template. Then
   remove the template.

To **RELOCATE** a device, do the following:

- Pick up and replace the device as described in the effect that relocated it.
  This can involve a template, or might place the device at a ship's guides.
- A device that relocates does not count as moving through or overlapping
  obstacles.

Some devices can detonate. When a device **DETONATES**, a number of effects
trigger depending on the type of device. After resolving these effects, remove
that device.

- See [Appendix](/search?q=Appendix) for examples of dropping and launching.
- One side of each device has a white boarder to help distinguish which
  player it belongs to.
- Most devices are placed during the [System Phase](/article/System_Phase). Each ship can place a
  device only once per System Phase.
- Most devices have an associated upgrade card that lets the player spend

  <Charge /> to place that device. Many of these cards are payload (<Device />)
  upgrades.

- When an effect instructs a ship to place a device associated with a
  different card (e.g. “drop 1 bomb”), that ship must pay all costs (such as
  spending <Charge/>) and place the device as its associated card dictates. Other
  effects can modify how it is placed (e.g. the TIE Bomber's Nimble Bomber
  ship ability) as normal.
- Each ship cannot place a device and [decloak](/article/Cloak) in the same phase.
- Devices are not [obstacles](/article/Obstacles), unless otherwise stated, but are [objects](/article/Objects).
- If a device is placed overlapping a ship, it is placed under the ship's base.
- If a device that detonates when overlapped is placed under more than
  one ship's base, it detonates instantly and the player placing the device
  chooses which ship it affects.
- The guides on a device count as part of the device for the purposes of
  measuring range to or from it as well as overlapping and moving through it.
- A device cannot be placed so that a portion of the device would be outside
  the play area. If this would happen, play is reversed to before the device
  was placed—the device is not placed, any charges spent and other costs
  paid are recovered, and the player can choose to not place that device.
- If a ship [partially executes a maneuver](/article/Partially_Exexutes), only the portion of the template
  that is between the starting and final position of the ship is counted for the
  purpose of moving through or overlapping a device. Ignore the portion of the
  template that the ship moved backward along when resolving the maneuver.
