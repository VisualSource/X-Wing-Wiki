<Header title="reload" icon={<Reload />} />

Pilots can reload to rearm ordnance tubes by moving around ammo on their
ship. When a ship performs the <Reload/> action, it reloads by performing the
following steps:

1. Choose one of the ship's equipped <Torpedo/>, <Missile/>, or <Device/> upgrade cards that has
   fewer active <Charge/> than its charge limit.
2. That card recovers one <Charge/>.
3. The ship gains one [disarm](/article/Disarm) token.

Additionally:

- If an ability instructs a player to reload, this is different than performing
  a <Reload/> action. A ship that reloads without performing the action can still
  perform the <Reload/> action this round.
