on the [attack range](/article/Attack_Range). For attack range 1, the attacker rolls one additional
attack die during the Roll Attack Dice step. For attack range 3, the defender
rolls one additional defense die during the Roll Defense Dice step.

- Range bonuses are applied for all attacks unless stated
  otherwise. Some [special weapons](/article/Special_Weapons) have a small ordnance
  icon on them to indicate that range bonuses cannot be
  applied with attacks using those weapons.
- Huge ships have additional rules for attacks at range 4 and 5. See
  [Appendix: Huge Ships](/article/Huge_Ships)
