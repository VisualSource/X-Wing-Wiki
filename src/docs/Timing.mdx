<Header title="Timing"/>

There are several terms used to indicate the specific timing of an effect:

* **Before:** The effect resolves immediately preceding the timing specified.
* **At the start of:** This timing is used with a specific phase or step. The
effect triggers before anything occurs during that phase or step.
* **While:** This term is often used in combination with multi-stepped game
effects such as an attack, an action, or a maneuver. Although less specific
than the other timings, this term is used to narrow down when the ability
is resolved during the round. Additional verbiage is required to identify
when exactly the effect is applied.
    + For example, in the context of an attack, if the ability rolls additional
    attack dice, the ability triggers during the Roll Attack Dice step. If the
    ability modifies defense dice, the ability triggers during the Modify
    Defense Dice step.
* **At the end of:** This timing is used with a specific phase or step of
ship's activation. This effect triggers after the normal effects of that
phase or step have occurred.
* **After:** The effect resolves immediately following the timing specified.

The [ability queue](/article/Ability_Queue) is used to resolve abilities that would resolve simultaneously.
