Pilots can calculate, using advanced computing power to
increase their combat performance. When a ship performs the
<Calculate/> action, it gains one calculate token.
A ship is **CALCULATING** while it has at least one calculate token. Calculate
tokens are circular, green tokens. A calculating ship follows these rules:

* While a calculating ship performs an attack, during the Modify Attack Dice
step, it may spend one or more calculate tokens to change that many of
its <Focus/> results to <Hit/> results.

* While a calculating ships defends, during the Modify Defense Dice step, it
may spend one or more calculate tokens to change that many of its <Focus/>
Additionally:

* A ship cannot spend calculate tokens to change <Focus/> results to <Evade/> or <Hit/>
results if it does not have any <Focus/> results.
* If a card ability instructs a ship to gain a calculate token, this is different
than performing a <Calculate/> action. A ship that gains the token without
performing the action can still perform the <Calculate/> action this round.
