Before playing, resolve the following steps:

1. Gather Forces: Each player places their ships and upgrade cards on the
table in front of them. For each ship that has a [shield](/article/Charge) value, [charge limit](/article/Limit), or
[Force capacity](/article/Charge), place the corresponding <Shield/>, <Charge/>, or <Forcepower/> above the ship and/or
upgrade cards. Each player assigns [ID markers](/article/Id_Marker) to each of their ships.
2. **Determine Player Order:** Randomly determine the first player as
follows:
    1. Each player rolls three attack dice. The player with the most <Crit/> results
    is the first player.
    2. In the case of a tie, the first player is the player with the most <Focus/>
    results.
    3. If there is still a tie, the first player is the player with the most <Hit/>
    results.
    4. If there is still a tie, players reroll the dice and follow the above rules
    until the tie is broken.
* This roll cannot be modified by game effects.

3. **Establish Play Area:** Establish a 3' x 3' (91 cm x 91 cm) [play area](/article/Play_Area)
on a flat surface or use a game mat, such as the Fantasy Flight Games
**Starfield Game Mat**. Then players pick opposite edges of the play
area to be their player edges.
4. **Place Obstacles:** In player order, players take turns choosing an
[obstacle](/article/Obstacles) and placing it into the play area until all six obstacles have been
placed. Obstacles must be placed beyond [range](/article/Range) 1 of each other and
beyond range 2 of each edge of the play area.
5. **Place Forces:** Players place their ships into the play area in [initiative
order](/article/Initiative) from lowest to highest initiative, using player order as a tiebreaker.
Ships must be placed within range 1 of their player edge. When a ship
with a turret arc indicator is placed, the player rotates the arc to select a
standard arc. Each ship with a turret arc indicator may rotate its indicator
when the ship is placed.
6. **Prepare Other Components:** Shuffle the damage deck and place it
facedown outside the play area. If the players have more than one damage
deck, each player uses their own deck.
Then the supply of range rulers, templates, dice, and tokens is created
near the play area.

Additionally:

* If a card has the **“SETUP:”** header, the ability that follows the header is
resolved during the appropriate step of setup.
