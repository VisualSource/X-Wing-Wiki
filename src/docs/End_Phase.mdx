The End Phase is the fifth phase of the [round](/article/Round). During the End Phase, the
following occur in this order:

1. Abilities that occur "at the start of the End Phase" form an ability queue
and resolve.
2. Abilities that occur "during the End Phase" form an ability queue and resolve.
3. All circular [tokens](/article/Tokens) are removed from all ships (green, then orange).
4. Each card with a [recurring charge icon](/article/Charges#recurring-charges) recovers that many charges. Each
card with a [negative recurring charge icon](/article/Charges#negative-recurring-charges) loses that many charges.
After this phase, the criteria for [winning the game](/article/Winning_The_Game) are checked. If the game
did not end, the [Planning Phase](/article/Planning_Phase) of the next round begins.
