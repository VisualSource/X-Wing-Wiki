<Header title="guides" />

Each ship's base has two pairs of guides, one pair on the front and one pair on
the back. Some [devices](/article/Device) also have a pair of guides.

- Guides on a ship's base are ignored only while measuring [range](/article/Range) or
  determining whether a ship is in an [arc](/article/Arc).
