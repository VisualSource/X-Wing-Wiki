Pilots can SLAM by activating their SubLight Acceleration Motors and
careening through space at incredible speeds. A ship performs a <Slam/> action by
performing the following steps:

1. The player chooses a [maneuver](/article/Maneuver) from the ship's [dial](/article/Dial). The maneuver must
   match the [speed](/article/Speed) of the maneuver that the ship executed this round.
2. The ship executes the chosen maneuver.
3. The ship gains one [disarm](/article/Disarm) token.

A ship can perform a <Slam/> action only during its activation in the Activation
Phase. Therefore a ship cannot perform a <Slam/> action if it is granted an action at
any other time.

- A <Slam/> action fails if the final position of the ship would cause it to [flee](/article/Flee).
- When a ship performs a <Slam/> action, it has performed an action as well as
  executed a maneuver for the sake of abilities.
