<Header title="play area" />

The play area is the defined area on a flat surface on which the ships are
placed. After executing a [maneuver](/article/Maneuver), if any part of a ship's base is outside the
play area, that ship has [fled](/article/Flee).
The recommended play area for a standard 20 point game is 3' x 3' (91 cm
x 91cm). If playing with other squad point totals, the players can expand or
contract the play area in one or both dimensions to create a suitable space
for the game.
