Ships can perform attacks which thematically represents the ship firing its
blaster cannons, ordnance, or other weapons.

If a ship performs an attack, it becomes the attacker then follows these steps:

1. **Declare Target:** During this step, the attacking player identifies and
        <OffsetLeft>
        1. **Measure Range:** The attacking player measures [range](/article/Range) from the
            attacker to any number of enemy ships and determines which enemy
            ships are in which of its [arcs](/article/Arc)
        1. **Choose Weapon:** The attacking player chooses one of the
            attacker's [primary](/article/Primary_Weapon) or [special](/article/Special_Weapon) weapons.
        1. **Declare Defender:** The attacking player chooses an enemy ship
            to be the defender. The defender must meet the requirements defined
            by the weapon.
        1. **Pay Costs:** The attacker must pay any costs for performing the attack.
        </OffsetLeft>
    * During the Declare Target step, the [attack arc](/article/Attack_Arc) is the arc that corresponds
        to the chosen weapon. The [attack range](/article/Attack_Range) is determined by measuring
        range from the closest point of the attacker to the closest point of the
        defender that is **in** the attack arc
    * A primary weapon requires the attack range to be range 0-3. A primary
        weapon has no cost by default.
    * Special weapons have different requirements specified by the source of
        the attack.
    * If there is no valid target for the chosen weapon, or if the attacker cannot
        pay the costs required for the attack, the attacking player either chooses
        a different weapon or chooses not to attack.
1. **Attack Dice:** During this step, the attacking player rolls attack dice
and the players can modify the dice.
        <OffsetLeft>
            1. **Roll Attack Dice:** The attacking player determines the number
                of attack dice to roll. Starting with the attack value, modifiers that
                increase or decrease the number of attack dice (such as range bonus
                and other effects) are applied. Next, if any minimum or maximum
                number of dice has been set, that limit is applied. There is always a
                minimum of 0 and a maximum of 6. Then they roll that many dice.
        </OffsetLeft>

    * While performing a primary attack at attack range 0, attack dice cannot be added.

        <OffsetLeft>
            1. **Modify Attack Dice:** The players resolve abilities that modify the
                attack dice. The defending player resolves their abilities first, then the
                attacking player resolves their abilities.
        </OffsetLeft>

    * While performing a primary attack at attack range 0,the attacker's dice
        cannot be modified, except by the defender.
    * The most common ways the attacker modifies attack dice are by spending
        a [focus](/article/Focus) [token](/article/Token) or spending a [lock](/article/Lock) it has on the defender.
    * Each defense die cannot be rerolled more than once during an attack.

1. **Defense Dice:**  During this step, the defending player rolls a number of
defense dice equal to the ship's [agility](/article/Agility) value and the players can modify the dice.

        <OffsetLeft>
            1. **Roll Defense Dice:** The defending player determines a number of
            defense dice to roll. Starting with the defender's agility value, modifiers
            that increase or decrease the number of defense dice (such as range
            bonus, whether the attack is being obstructed by an obstacle, and
            other effects) are applied. Next, if any minimum or maximum number
            of dice has been set, that limit is applied. There is always a minimum
            of 0 and a maximum of 6. Then they roll that many dice.
            1. **Modify Defense Dice:** The players resolve abilities that modify
            the defense dice. The attacking player resolves their abilities first,
            then the defending player resolves their abilities.
        </OffsetLeft>
    
    * While defending at range 0, enemy ships cannot reduce the number of
    defense dice you roll, cancel your results, or modify your results.

    * The most common ways the defender modifies defense dice are by
    spending a focus or [evade](/article/Evade) token.

    * Each defense die cannot be rerolled more than once during an attack.

1. **Neutralize Results:** During this step, pairs of attack and defense
dice neUtRalize each other. Dice are **NEUTRALIZED** in the following order:

        <OffsetLeft>
            1. Pairs of <Evade/> and <Hit/> results are canceled.
            1. Pairs of <Evade/> and <Crit/> results are canceled.
        </OffsetLeft>

    The attack [hits](/article/Hit) if at least one <Hit/> or <Crit/> result remains uncanceled; otherwise, the attack [misses](/article/Miss).
    
1. **Deal Damage:** If the attack hits, the [defender suffers](/article/Defender) damage for each
uncanceled <Hit/> and <Crit/> result in the following order:

        <OffsetLeft>
            1. The defender suffers 1 <Hit/> damage for each uncanceled <Hit/> result.
            Then cancel all <Hit/> results.
            1. The defender suffers 1 <Crit/> damage for each uncanceled <Crit/> result.
            Then cancel all <Crit/> results.
        </OffsetLeft>
  
1. **Aftermath:** Abilities that trigger after an attack are resolved in the
following order.

        <OffsetLeft>
            1. Resolve any of the defending player's abilities that trigger after a ship
            defends or is destroyed, excluding abilities that grant a bonus attack.
            1. Resolve any of the attacking player's abilities that trigger after a ship
            performs an attack or is destroyed, excluding abilities that grant a
            bonus attack.
            1. Resolve any of the defending player's abilities that trigger after a ship
            defends or is destroyed that grant a bonus attack.
            1. Resolve any of the attacking player's abilities that trigger after a ship
            performs an attack or is destroyed that grant a bonus attack.
        </OffsetLeft>

* Each ship may perform one standard attack when it engages during the
    Engagement Phase

* If a ship is [destroyed](/article/Destroyed_Ship) at an initiative step during the [Engagement Phase](/article/Engagement_Phase), the
ship is not removed until all ships of the attacker's [initiative](/article/Initiative) have engaged.

* During an attack, a ship cannot choose to roll fewer dice than it is
supposed to roll.

* If a player would roll more dice than they have available, keep track of the
rolled results and reroll the dice necessary to equal the total number of
dice the player would have rolled all at once. Note that these dice are not
considered rerolled for the purposes of modifying dice.
