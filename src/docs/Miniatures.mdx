<Header title="miniatures" />

Each player must have the miniatures for each ship in their squad. Players
are allowed to customize their miniatures as they like but must follow these
guidelines:

- The miniature must be made from a majority of miniature parts
  from the
  **Star Wars: X-Wing** miniatures line.
- The miniature must be easily identifiable as the ship it represents
- Players may not customize a miniature in such a way that any part of
  the miniature represents the intellectual property of any party except
  Lucasfilm, including: copyrighted logos, symbols, iconic elements, or other
  iconography.
- The size or pose of a customized miniature cannot interfere with
  gameplay.
- Where possible, miniatures must always be attached to a
  Star Wars:
  X-Wing base that is the appropriate size and shape of the original
  miniature. If two or more miniatures in play could potentially touch,
  causing conflict with movement or placement of ships, players may
  remove the miniature from its plastic pegs until the conflict is resolved.
- Players cannot modify ship bases to alter their size or shape.
- Ship pegs (including the connecting pegs affixed to ship miniatures) may
  be modified or replaced with a different connecting method.
- Each ship card has a ship type centered at the bottom of the card.
  Players may use any
  **Star Wars: X-Wing** miniature that represents
  the same ship model as the pilot in their squadron, so long as it is easily
  recognizable as the ship it represents and has the appropriate ship
  token fitted in the ship's base. Example: The Customized YT-1300 Light
  Freighter miniature may be used to represent a Scavenged YT-1300 if the
  Escape Craft piece is removed and an appropriate ship token is fitted to
  the ship's base.
