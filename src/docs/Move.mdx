<Header title="Move" />

A ship **MOVES** when it executes a [maneuver](/article/Maneuver) or otherwise changes position using a
template (such as [barrel rolling](/article/Barrel_Roll) or [boosting](/article/Boost)).

A ship **MOVES THROUGH** an [object](/article/Objects) if the template is placed on that object when
the ship moves.

- If a ship moves through an [obstacle](/article/Obstacles), it suffers the effects of that obstacle.
- If a ship moves through a [device](/article/Deivce), it can suffer effects based on the device.
- If a ship moves through another ship, there is no inherent effect. Due to the
  physical miniature being in the way, players should mark the positions of any
  intervening ships and temporarily remove them. To mark an intervening ship's
  position, players can either use the position markers provided in the core set
  or place templates in the ships' guides or along the side of the base. Then
  those ships are physically removed to complete the move. After the move is
  complete, the removed ships are returned to their original positions.
