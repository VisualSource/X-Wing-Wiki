<Header title="attack range" version="1.4.4" />

During an attack, the **ATTACK RANGE** is determined by measuring [range](/article/Range) from
the closest point of the attacker to the closest point of the defender that is in
the [attack arc](/article/Attack_Arc).

- While measuring range for abilities that do not specify the attack range, the
  range between the attacker and defender is measured from the closest point
  of the attacker to the closest point of the defender, ignoring the attack arc.

- While attacking a ship at range 0, the attack range is always 0.
