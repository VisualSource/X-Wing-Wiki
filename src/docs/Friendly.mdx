<Header title="friendly" />

All ships/[devices](/article/Device) controlled by the same player are **FRIENDLY** to each other
unless a card, game mode, scenario, or other effect states otherwise. Any
dice rolled by that player are friendly to those ships. This is in contrast with
[enemy](/article/Enemy) and allied.

- Ships cannot perform [attacks](/article/Attack) against friendly ships, unless specified otherwise.
- A ship is friendly to itself and can affect itself with any of its abilities that affect
  friendly ships, unless those abilities explicitly refer to “other” friendly ships.
