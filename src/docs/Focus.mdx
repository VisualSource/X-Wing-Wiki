Pilots can focus to concentrate and expand their combat prowess.
When a ship performs the <Focus/> action, it gains one focus token.

A ship is **FOCUSED** while it has at least one focus token. Focus
tokens are circular, green [tokens](/article/Tokens). A focused ship follows these rules:

- While a focused ship performs an [attack](/article/Attack), during the Modify Attack Dice step,
  it may spend a focus token to change all of its <Focus/> results to <Hit/> results.

- While a focused ship defends, during the Modify Defense Dice step, it may
  spend a focus token to change all of its <Focus/> results to <Evade/> results.

Additionally:

- A ship cannot spend a focus token to change <Focus/> results to <Evade/> or <Hit/>
  results if it does not have any <Focus/> results.

- If an ability instructs a ship to gain a focus token, this is different than
  performing a <Focus/> action. A ship that gains a token without performing the
  action can still perform the <Focus/> action this round.
