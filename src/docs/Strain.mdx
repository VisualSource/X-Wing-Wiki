A ship is **STRAINED** while it has at least one strain token. While
a strained ship defends, it rolls 1 fewer defense die. The strain
token is a red token.

- After a strained ship applies the effect to roll 1 fewer defense die this
  way, it removes 1 strain token.
- After a strained ship executes a blue maneuver, it removes 1 strain token..
