To represent that ships with the same initiative are essentially attacking at the
same time, if a ship is [destroyed](/article/Destroyed) during the [Engagement Phase](/article/Engagement_Phase), it is [removed](/article/Removed_From_The_Game)
after all ships that have the same initiative as the currently engaged ship have
engaged.
