<Header title="Disarmed" version="1.4.4" />

A ship is **DISARMED** if it has at least one disarm token. A
disarmed ship cannot perform [attacks](/article/Attack). The disarm token is a
circular, orange [token](/article/Token) and is removed during the [End Phase](/article/End_Phase).

perform attacks).
