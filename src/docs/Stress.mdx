A ship is **STRESSED** while it has at least one stress token. A
stressed ship cannot execute red [maneuvers](/article/Maneuver) or perform [actions](/article/Action).
The stress token is a red [token](/article/Tokens).

* A ship receives one stress token while it executes a red maneuver or after
it performs a red action. Additionally, a ship removes one stress token
while it executes a blue maneuver.
* If a stressed ship attempts to execute a red maneuver, it instead
executes a white [2 <Straight/>] maneuver.
    + After a stressed ship reveals a red maneuver, abilities that change the
    maneuver can be used. After resolving these abilities, if the ship would
    still execute a red maneuver, it instead executes a white [2 <Straight/>] maneuver.
* Huge ships have additional rules for stress (see [Appendix: Huge Ships](/article/Huge_Ships)).
