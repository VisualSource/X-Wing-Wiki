Pilots can jam to conduct electronic warfare and confuse other
ships' systems. When a ship performs the <Jam/> action, it jams. A
**JAMMING** ship is a ship that is attempting to jam by performing the
following steps:

1. Measure [range](/article/Range) from the jamming ship to any enemy ships.
2. Choose an enemy ship at range 1, or at range 1-2 in the jamming ship's <BullsEyeArc/>.
3. The chosen ship gains one jam token.

A ship is **JAMMED** if it has at least one jam token. Jam tokens are circular,
orange [tokens](/article/Tokens). When a ship becomes jammed, the player whose effect caused
the ship to gain the jam token chooses for the ship to either remove one of its
green tokens or break one of its [locks](/article/Lock). If either effect is resolved, it removes
the jam token. If the ship does not have any green tokens or is not maintaining
any locks, it remains jammed.

After a jammed ship gains a green token or acquires a lock, the jammed ship
removes that token or breaks that lock. Then it removes one jam token.

- Some [special weapons](/article/Special_Weapons) [inflict](/article/Inflict) jam tokens instead of dealing damage.
- While a ship attempts to jam, it [fails](/article/Fail) if no ship is chosen.
- Any [abilities](/article/Abilities) that cause a jammed ship to gain a green token or acquire a
  lock still trigger any effects that occur from resolving that ability even if
  the token is removed or the lock is broken. The jam token does not cause
  that ability to fail.
- If an ability instructs a ship to jam, this is different than performing a <Jam/>
  action. A ship that jams without performing the action can still perform
  the <Jam/> action this round.
- If a ship has multiple green tokens or locks, the player whose effect
  caused the ship to gain the jam token chooses which green token is
  removed or which lock is broken.
