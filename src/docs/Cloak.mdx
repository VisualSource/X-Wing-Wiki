Ships can cloak to become difficult to hit, and they can decloak
to move unpredictably. When a ship performs the <Cloak/> action, it
gains one cloak token.

A ship is **CLOAKED** while it has a cloak token. Cloak tokens are blue [tokens](/article/Tokens).
A cloaked ship has the following effects:

- Its [agility](/article/Agility) value is increased by 2.
- It is disarmed.
- It cannot perform the cloak action or gain a second cloak token.

During the [System Phase](/article/System_Phase), each cloaked ship may spend its cloak token to
**DECLOAK**. When a small ship decloaks, it must choose one of the following
effects:

1. Barrel roll using the [2 <Straight/>] template.
2. Boost using the [2 <Straight/>] template.

When a [medium or large](/article/) ship decloaks, it must choose one of the following
effects:

1. [Barrel roll](/article/Barrel_Roll) using the [1 <Straight/>] template.
2. [Boost](/article/Boost) using the [1 <Straight/>] template.

- Decloaking does not count as executing a [maneuver](/article/Maneuver) or performing an
  [action](/article/Action) but does count as a [move](/article/Move).
- A ship can decloak even while [stressed](/article/Stress).
- When a player declares to decloak a ship, that player must declare which
  type of boost or barrel roll it is going to perform before placing a template
  on the play area.
- If a decloak fails, the ship is returned to its prior position before it
  attempted the decloak and the cloak token is not removed.
- Each ship cannot drop or launch a [device](/article/Device) during the same phase that it
  decloaked.
