<Header title="flee" version="1.4.4"/>

A ship flees if any part of its base is outside the [play area](/article/Play_Area) at any time. A ship
that flees is [removed from the game](/article/Removed_From_Game).
* While a ship [moves](/article/Move), the ship does not flee if only the template is outside
the play area.
* Before a fleeing ship is removed from the game, the only effects it
resolves before being removed from the game are effects that trigger
when it flees.
* A ship cannot flee while resolving a [boost](/article/Boost), [barrel roll](/article/Barrel_Roll), [decloak](/article/Cloak), or [SLAM](/article/Slam).
* [Partially executing](/article/Partially_Executing) a maneuver can cause a ship to flee if any part of its
base is outside the play area after the maneuver.
