An arc is an area formed between the lines created by extending hash marks
or arc lines printed on a ship token to range 3. A ship is **IN** an arc if any part
of its base is inside that area.

- Arcs are measured beyond the base of ships. The portion of any object
  that lies beneath a ship is not in any of those ship's arcs.

### Standard Arcs

There are three types of **STANDARD ARCS** created from the crossed diagonal
arc lines:

<ImgCenter src="/images/standard_ship_arcs.webp" alt="Ships Arcs" />

1. **Front arc (<FrontArc/>):** This arc projects in the same direction that the ship is
   facing. Most ships have a primary <FrontArc/> weapon. Almost all <Cannon/>, <Torpedo/>, and <Missile/>
   weapons use this arc.

1. **Side arcs (<LeftArc/>, <RightArc/>):** These arcs are on the left (<LeftArc/>) or right (<RightArc/>) side
   of ships.

1. **Rear arc (<RearArc/>):** This arc projects in the opposite direction that the ship
   is facing. Some ships have a primary <RearArc/> weapon.

### Bullseye Arc

Inside of the front arc, each ship has a bullseye arc.

<ImgCenter src="/images/ship_bullseye_arc.webp" alt="Bullseye Arc" />

**Bullseye arc (<BullsEyeArc/>):** This arc is found inside the <FrontArc/>. If something is in a
ship's <BullsEyeArc/>, it is also in its <FrontArc/>.

- The <BullsEyeArc/> is the width and length of the range ruler.

- There is no intrinsic effect when a ship attacks a ship in its <BullsEyeArc/>, but card
  [abilities](/article/Abilities) may refer to it.

### Full Arcs

There are two **FULL ARCS** that use the midway line instead of the printed arc lines.

<ImgCenter src="/images/ship_full_arcs.webp" alt="Full Arc" />

1. **Full front arc (<FullFrontArc/>):** This arc covers all of the area in front of the ship.
   Some ships have primary <FullFrontArc/> weapons.

1. Full rear arc (<FullRearArc/>): This arc covers all of the area behind the ship.

Using the <FullFrontArc/>, <FullRearArc/>, and extending the midway line to range 3, the following
phrases are used to express specific spacial relationships between ships.

- **Behind:** If ship A is in the <FullRearArc/> of ship B and ship A does not cross the
  midway line of ship B, then ship A is **BEHIND** ship B.

- **In front of:** If ship A is in the <FullFrontArc/> of ship B and ship A does not cross
  the midway line of ship B, then ship A is **IN FRONT OF** ship B

- **Flanking:** If ship A crosses the midway line of ship B, then ship A is
  **FLANKING** ship B.

### Turret Arcs

Unlike other arcs, some weapons use turret arc indicators to select arcs.
There are two types of turret arc indicators: single turret (<SingleTurretArc/>) and double
turret (<DoubleTurretArc/>). During [setup](/article/Setup), a ship with a [primary](/article/Primary_Weapon) (or [special](/article/Special_Weapon)) <SingleTurretArc/> or <DoubleTurretArc/> weapon
adds the corresponding turret arc indicator to its base.

<ImgCenter src="/images/ship_turret_arcs.webp" alt="Turret Arcs" />

The turret arc indicator points toward one of the ship's four standard arcs.
The standard arc that the turret arc indicator is pointing toward is a <SingleTurretArc/> in
addition to still being a standard arc. While a ship performs a <SingleTurretArc/> attack, it can
attack a target that is in its <SingleTurretArc/> arc.

A ship with a double turret arc indicator has two <SingleTurretArc/> in
opposite directions.

A ship can adjust which standard arc(s) that its turret arc
indicator is pointing towards by using the [rotate](/article/Rotate) (<Rotate/>) action.

<ImgText
  src="/images/double_turret_indicator.webp"
  alt="Double Turret Arc Indicator"
  text="Double Turret Arc Indicator."
/>

Huge ships have additional rules for turret arc indicators (see [Appendix: Huge Ships](/article/Huge_Ships))

### Firing Arcs

A ship's firing arcs include all shaded arcs on the ship's ship token plus all

<SingleTurretArc /> arcs, if any.

- If an upgrade card gives a ship a <SingleTurretArc/> arc or primary weapon with a specified
  arc, those arcs are also firing arcs
