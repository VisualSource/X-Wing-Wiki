- During an [attack](/rules/Attack), a ship with an agility value of “0” can still roll additional defense dice granted by game effects such as the [range bonus](/rules/Range_Bouns) the attack being [obstructed](/rules/Obstructed) by an [obstacle](/rules/Obstacles), or other card [abilities](/rules/Abilities).

- Abilities or game effects that cause a ship to roll additional or fewer defense dice do not modify the agility value of the defender.

- All modifiers to agility are cumulative.

- After all modifiers have been applied, if the number of defense dice required for a roll is less than “0,” it is treated as “0.”.

- After all modifiers have applied, if the number of defense dice required for a roll is greater than "6," it is treated as "6.".
