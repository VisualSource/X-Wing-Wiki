While a ship moves, if it moves through or overlaps a Blaze obstacle, it
suffers the following effect:

* After the move is resolved, roll one attack die. On a <Hit/> or <Crit/> result, the
ship suffers one <Hit/> damage; on a <Focus/> result, it gains one stress token.
Then the ship skips its Perform Action step this round.

After a remote relocates, if it relocates so that it at range 0 of a Blaze
obstacle, it suffers one <Hit/> damage.

While a unit defends, if the attack is obstructed by a Blaze, it rolls 1 additional
defense die
