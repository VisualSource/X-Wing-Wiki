This section contains diagrams for huge ships.

## EXAMPLE OF A [2 <RightBank/>] MANEUVER

This example shows how a huge ship executes a bank maneuver.

## EXAMPLE OF OVERLAPPING A HUGE SHIP
This example shows how a huge ship overlap of another huge ship is resolved.

<ImgCenter src="/images/HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_2A.webp" alt="Raider attempting maneuver"/>
<TextCenter>
    Fig. 2a: The Raider-class corvette is attempting to execute a [2 <RightBank/>] maneuver    
</TextCenter>

<ImgCenter src="/images/HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_2B.webp" alt="Raider overlap CR90"/>
<TextCenter text="ig. 2b: The Raider-class corvette would overlap the CR90 corvette."/>

<ImgCenter src="/images/HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_2C.webp" alt="Overlap resolved"/>
<TextCenter>
    Fig. 2c: To resolve this, the Raider instead executes a [1 <RightBank/>] maneuver, 
    since it is a speed 1 lower maneuver that does not cause it to overlap the CR90
</TextCenter>

## EXAMPLE OF OVERLAPPING A STANDARD SHIP

This example shows how a huge ship overlap of a standard ship is resolved.

<ImgCenter src="/images/HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_3A.webp" alt="Overlap resolved"/>
<TextCenter>
  Fig. 3a: The Raider-class corvette would overlap the YT-1300.
  To resolve this, the YT-1300's player picks it up and sets it aside.
</TextCenter>

<ImgCenter src="/images/HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_3B.webp" alt="Overlap resolved"/>
<TextCenter>
    Fig. 3b: After the Raider moves, the YT-1300's player places it in the
    Raider's full rear arc [<FullRearArc/>] at range 0-1. Then a chosen opponent may
    rotate the YT-1300 by 90 ÌŠ.

## EXAMPLE OF TRACKING <SingleTurretArc/> ON A HUGE SHIP

This CR90 has a Point-Defense Battery [<Hardpoint/>] equipped, so a <DoubleTurretArc/> turret arc indicator needs
to be placed on a mount. A black indicator is selected and placed on the front mount.


<ImgCenter src="/images/HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_4A.webp" alt="Overlap resolved"/>
<TextCenter>
    Since the black <DoubleTurretArc/> was used on the front mount, the corresponding black <DoubleTurretArc/>
    mount marker is placed on the Point-Defense Battery upgrade card
</TextCenter>

<ImgCenter src="/images/HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_4B.webp" alt="Overlap resolved"/>
<TextCenter>
    This CR90 also has a Turbolaser Battery [<Hardpoint/>] equipped. Since a black turret arc
    indicator was used on the front mount, the white <SingleTurretArc/>
    is used for the rear mount.
</TextCenter>

<ImgCenter src="/images/HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_4C.webp" alt="Overlap resolved"/>

<TextCenter>
   Additionally, the corresponding white <SingleTurretArc/> mount marker is placed on the Turbolaser Battery upgrade card.
</TextCenter>

<ImgCenter src="/images/HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_4D.webp" alt="Overlap resolved"/>

## EXAMPLE OF A HUGE SHIP WITH MULTIPLE <SingleTurretArc/>

This CR90 has a Point-Defense Battery [<Hardpoint/>] and a Turbolaser Battery [<Hardpoint/>] equipped. The
Point-Defense Battery's black <DoubleTurretArc/> turret arc indicator was place on the front mount and
the Turbolaser Battery's white <SingleTurretArc/> turret arc indicator was place on the rear mount.

<ImgCenter src="/images/HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_5A.webp" alt="Overlap resolved"/>
<TextCenter>
    The Point-Defense Battery can attack from the CR90's <LeftArc/> and <RightArc/> . The Turbolaser Battery can attack from the CR90's <FrontArc/>.
</TextCenter>

<ImgCenter src="/images/HUGE_SHIPS_EXAMPLES_5B.webp" alt="Overlap resolved"/>
<TextCenter>
    If the CR90 tried to attack this TIE fighter, the attack range for the Turbolaser Battery
    would be range 1, which is too close, but the range for both the Point-Defense Battery
    and its primary weapon is range 2.
