This section contains the official errata that have been made to individual
cards and other game components in
Star Wars: X-Wing. Errata
overrides the originally printed information on the game component it applies
to. Unless errata from a game component appears below, the original English
printing of that component is considered accurate, and overrides all other
printings. This includes translated cards, promotional cards, and printings
which may appear in other products.
