<Header title="dice modification" version="1.4.4"/>

Players can modify dice by spending various tokens and by resolving abilities.
Dice can be modified in the following ways:

* **Add:** To add a die result, place an unused die displaying the result next
to the rolled dice. A die added in this way is treated as a normal die for all
purposes and can be modified and canceled.
* **Change:** To change a die result, rotate the die so that its faceup side
displays the new result.
* **Reroll:** To reroll a die result, pick up the die and roll it again.
* **Spend:** To spend a result, remove the die from the dice pool.

Additionally:

* Dice modification occurs during the respective Modify Attack Dice or
Modify Defense Dice step, unless otherwise stated.
* Although dice can be modified by multiple effects, each die cannot be
rerolled more than once.
* If an ability instructs a ship to spend a result, it cannot spend another
ship's results unless stated otherwise.
* [Canceling](/article/Cancel) dice is not a dice modification.
* Rolling additional dice or fewer dice is not a dice modification.

* If a die cannot be changed to a given result, nothing happens.
    + For example, an attack die cannot be changed to an <Evade/> result because
    that result does not appear on that die.
