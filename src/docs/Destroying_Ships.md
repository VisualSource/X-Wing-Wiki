A ship is **DESTROYED** after it has a number of damage cards that equals or exceeds its hull value. A destroyed ship is placed on its ship card.

- After a ship is destroyed in a phase other than the [Engagement Phase](/rules/Engagement_Phase), it is [removed from the game](/rules/Removed_From_The_Game).
- If a ship is destroyed during the Engagement Phase, it is removed after all ships that have the same initiative as the currently engaged ship have engaged, which is called [simultaneous fire](/rules/Simulatneous_Fire).
- If an effect triggers after a ship is destroyed, the effect resolves immediately, before the ship is removed.
- A destroyed ship's [abilities](/rules/Abilities) remain active until that ship is removed unless the ability specifies a different timing for the effect to end, such as “until the end of the Engagement Phase.” Such effects remain active until the end of the specified time.
