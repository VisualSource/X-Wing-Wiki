<Header title="rotate a ship" />

Some abilities and effects instruct a player to "rotate a ship 90 ÌŠ" independent
of a maneuver. These effects could also read "rotate your ship [a number of
degrees]" or "rotate [a number of degrees]," but importantly, they do not
simply read "rotate" (which refers to the rotate action and its effect).

- Rotating a ship does not count as moving.
- If rotating a ship would cause its base to overlap a ship (such as if the
  front or rear guides would physically be placed over that ship's base), it
  cannot be rotated and the effect is not resolved.
- If rotating a ship would cause its base to overlap a non-ship object (such
  as an obstacle or device), it does not resolve the effects of overlapping
  that object. However, it is at range 0 of that object, and applies any
  effects that entails.
