<Header title="initiative" />

A ship's initiative value is the orange number to the left of the ship's name
on its ship card. Initiative is used to determine the order in which ships can
use abilities during the [System Phase](/article/System_Phase), activate during the [Activation Phase](/article/Activation_Phase),
engage during the [Engagement Phase](/article/Engagement_Phase), and are placed during [setup](/article/Setup).

- If several abilities alter the initiative of a ship, only the most recent ability
  is applied.

      + If the most recent effect ends (such as “at the end of the Engagement
      Phase”), the ship's initiative returns to the initiative established by the
      most recent ability that is still active.
