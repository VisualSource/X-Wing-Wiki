<Header title="bouns attack" version="1.4.4"/>

If a card instructs a ship to perform a bonus attack, it performs an additional
[attack](/article/Attack) during the Aftermath step.

* A few [special weapons](/article/Special_Weapon) provide a bonus attack using the same weapon.
While performing this type of bonus attack, the same arc requirements,
range requirements, and cost requirements are followed unless stated
otherwise.

    +  For example, a ship that attacked with the Cluster Missiles card can
perform a bonus attack against another ship at range 1 of the defender
and ignore the <Lock/> requirement. The range (1-2), arc (<FrontArc/>), and cost
(spending 1 <Charge/> charge) are maintained for the bonus attack.

* A ship can perform only one bonus attack per [round](/article/Round).

* If both players have a bonus attack that triggers after an attack, the
defending player resolves their bonus attack first.
* Huge ships have further rules for bonus attacks. See [Appendix: Huge Ships](/article/Huge_Ships).
