Boost represents a pilot activating additional thrusters to move farther forward. When a ship performs a :boost: action, it boosts by following these steps:

1. Choose the [1 :straight:], [1 :bank-left:], or [1 :bank-right:] template.
2. Set the template between the ship's front [guides](/rules/Guides).
3. Place the ship at the opposite end of the template and slide the rear guides of the ship into the template.
4. Return the template to the [supply](/rules/Supply).

![X Wing Boost](xwing-boost.webp)

> An X-wing boosts to the left, straight, or to the right.

- When a player declares to boost a ship, that player also declares whether
  the ship is boosting straight, left, or right.
- While attempting to place a ship to complete a boost, the boost can [fail](/rules/fail) if any of the following occurs: + The ship's final positions would cause the ship to [overlap](/rules/overlap) another ship. + The ship would overlap or [move through](/rules/Move_Through) an [obstacle](/rules/Obstacle). + The ship's final position would cause it to be outside the play area (and therefore would cause that ship to [flee](/rules/Flee)).
- If a boost fails, the ship is returned to its prior position before it attempted the boost. If this was part of a :boost: action, that action fails.
- The player cannot choose to fail a boost if the final position would not cause the action to fail.
- Performing a boost does not count as executing a maneuver but does count as a move.
- If an ability instructs a ship to boost, this is different than performing a :boost: action. A ship that boosts without performing the action can still perform the :boost: action this round.
