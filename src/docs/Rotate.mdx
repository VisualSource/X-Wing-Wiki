<Header title="rotate" icon={<RotateArc />} />

Pilots can rotate to alert a gunner or aim one of the ship's turret-mounted
armaments. When a ship performs the <RotateArc/> action, it rotates the turret arc
indicator to select any other standard [arc](/article/Arc).

- If a ship rotates a double turret arc indicator, it must select the other two
  standard arcs it was not already selecting.
- If an ability instructs a ship to rotate its <SingleTurretArc/> indicator, this is different
  than performing a <RotateArc/> action. A ship that rotates its <SingleTurretArc/> indicator without
  performing the action can still perform a <RotateArc/> action this round.
- This is distinct from an ability that instructs a ship to "rotate your ship [a
  number of degrees]," which is described under [Rotate a Ship](/article/Roate_A_Ship).
