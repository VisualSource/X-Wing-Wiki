<Header title="fuse marker"/>

A device or obstacle is **FUSED** while it has at least one fuse marker.
When a fused device would detonate, one fuse marker is removed
from that device instead, and that device does not detonate. When
a fused obstacle would be removed, one fuse marker is removed
from that obstacle instead, and that obstacle is not removed.
