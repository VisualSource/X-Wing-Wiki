A ship is tRactoRed while it has equal to or greater than a
specific number of tractor tokens, according to its [size](/article/Ship_Size): a small
ship requires at least one tractor token, a medium ship requires
at least two tractor tokens, and a large ship require at least
three tractor tokens. A tractor token is a orange token.

The first time a ship becomes tractored each round, the player whose effect
applied the tractor token may choose one of the following effects:

- Perform a [barrel roll](/article/Barrel_Roll) using the [1 <Straight/>] maneuver template. The player applying
  the effect selects the direction of the barrel roll and the ship's final position.
- Perform a [boost](/article/Boost) using the [1 <Straight/>] maneuver template.

This move cannot cause the ship to [move through](/article/Move) or [overlap](/article/Overlap) an [obstacle](/article/Obstacle).
After a ship is moved this way, if an opponent moved it, the ship's player may
choose to have the ship rotate 90 ÌŠ to the left or right. If they do, the ship
gains one stress token.

While a tractored ship defends, it rolls one fewer defense die.

- Some [special weapons](/article/Special_Weapons) [inflict](/article/Inflict) tractor tokens instead of dealing damage.
- Huge ships have additional rules for tractor tokens (see [Appendix: Huge Ships](/article/Huge_Ships)).
