Pilots can evade to fly defensively. When a ship performs an <Evade/>
action, it gains one evade token.

A ship is evading while it has at least one evade token. Evade tokes are
circular, green [tokens](/article/Tokens). While an evading ship defends, during the Modify
Defense Dice step, it can spend one or more evade tokens to change that
many of its blank or <Focus/> results to <Evade/> results.

- If an ability instructs a ship to gain an evade token, this is different than
  performing an <Evade/> action. A ship that gains the token without performing
  the action can still perform the <Evade/> action this round.
