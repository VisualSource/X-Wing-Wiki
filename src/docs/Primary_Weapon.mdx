<Header title="primary weapon" />

Each ship has up to two primary weapons listed on its ship
card. Each primary weapon has an [arc](/article/Arc) symbol and a red
attack value. During a ship's attack, it chooses a weapon
to perform an attack with. If it performs an [attack](/article/Attack) using a
primary weapon, the attack value indicates how many attack
dice it rolls during the Roll Attack Dice step and the arc
symbol indicates where the defender must be located.

- A primary weapon requires the attack range to be range 0-3 and has no
  cost by default.
- Since primary weapons are not special weapons, they do not benefit from
  abilities that trigger while performing a special attack
