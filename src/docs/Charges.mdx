**CHARGES** are two-side punchboard components that track certain limited
resources. Some ship and upgrade cards have charges to denote their use.
All charges obey the following rules:

- When an effect instructs a ship to **RECOVER** a charge, an inactive charge
  on that ship (ship or upgrade card) is flipped to its active side. A card
  cannot recover a charge if all of its charges are on their active side.
- When an effect instructs a ship to **LOSE** a charge, a charge assigned to
  the relevant card is flipped to the inactive side.
- When a ship **SPENDS** a charge, that charge is lost. A ship cannot spend
  a charge for an effect if all of its charges that are available for that effect
  are already inactive.
- Each card with a **CHARGE LIMIT** (the number) starts the game with a number
  of charges equal to the charge limit. Each charge starts on its active side.
- Charges associated with charge limits that have the recurring charge
  symbol are called **RECURRING CHARGES**. Alternatively, charges associated
  with charge limits that do not have the recurring charge symbol are called
  **NON-RECURRING CHARGES**. Charges that are instead lost over time are
  called **NEGATIVE RECURRING CHARGES**.

### CHARGE TYPES

There are four types of charges:

- **STANDARD CHARGES** (<Charge/>), which represent limited resources like
  munitions and a pilot's stamina. These have a golden number.
- **FORCE CHARGES** (<Forcepower/>), which represent the ebbing and flowing power of
  the Force: These have a purple number.
- **SHIELDS** (<Shield/>), which represent a ship's defensive shielding. These have a
  blue number.
- **ENERGY** (<Energy/>), which represents a huge ship's draw of power from its
  engines (see [Appendix: Huge Ships](/article/Huge_Ships)). These have a magenta number.

### Recurring Charges

  Some charge limits, shield capacities, and all Force capacities have a
  **RECURRING CHARGE SYMBOL**. During the [End Phase](/article/End_Phase), each
  card with a recurring charge symbol recovers one charge per recurring charge
  symbol.

### Negative Recurring Charges

  Some charge limits have a **NEGATIVE RECURRING CHARGE SYMBOL**. During the End
  Phase, each card with a negative recurring charge symbol loses one charge per
  negative recurring charge symbol.
</TextImgDec>

### Standard Charge (<Charge/>)

Standard charges (<Charge/>) can represent anything from limited munitions to
exhaustible abilities that can only be performed infrequently.

- **SHIP CHARGES** are charges on ship cards and **UPGRADE CHARGES** are
  charges on upgrade cards.
- If an upgrade card has a charge limit, the <Charge/> are placed above that
  upgrade card (not the ship card it is attached to). + If an upgrade card instructs the ship to spend <Charge/>, those <Charge/> are spent
  from that upgrade card.

### Force Charge (<Forcepower/>)

Force charges (<Forcepower/>) represent how some pilots or crew members can exert
their influence over the Force.

While it performs an attack, a ship can spend any number of <Forcepower/> during the
Attack Dice step to change that number of its <Focus/> results to <Hit/> results.
While it defends, a ship can spend any number of <Forcepower/> during the Defense Dice
step to change that number of its <Focus/> results to <Evade/> results.

- If an upgrade card has a Force capacity, this increases the Force capacity
  of the ship. The <Forcepower/> are placed above the ship card it is attached to (not
  the upgrade card). + A ship card that does not have a Force capacity on its ship card has a
  Force capacity of “0,” but that capacity can be increased by upgrade
  cards that have a Force capacity. + If a ship has multiple sources of recurring <Forcepower/>, the recurring charge
  symbols do not stack. During the End Phase, each ship with a Force
  capacity recovers a number of <Forcepower/> equal the highest number of
  recurring <Forcepower/> symbols among the cards that grant it a Force capacity.
  For example, if a ship with a Force capacity of "0" has two <Crew/> cards
  that each grant it a Force capacity of "+1" and have one recurring <Forcepower/>
  symbol each, that ship has a Force capacity of "2," but recovers only
  one <Forcepower/> during the End Phase. + If an upgrade card instructs the ship to spend <Forcepower/>, those <Forcepower/> are spent
  from the ship card.

### Shield (<Shield/>)

Shields (<Shield/>) represent defensive energy barriers. A ship is shielded while it
has at least one active shield.
While a ship defends, shields provide it protection against damage. See
[Damage](/article/Damage). Additionally:

- If an upgrade card has a shield capacity, this increases the shield capacity
  of the ship. The <Shield/> are placed above the ship card it is attached to (not
  the upgrade card).

      + A ship card that does not have a shield capacity on its ship card has a
      shield capacity of “0,” but that capacity can be increased by upgrade
      cards that have a shield capacity.
      + During the End Phase, each ship with a shield capacity recovers a
      number of <Shield/> equal the number of recurring <Shield/> symbols on its ship card
      (only huge ships have recurring <Shield/> symbols, see [Appendix: Huge Ships](/article/Huge_Ships)).
      + If an upgrade card instructs the ship to spend <Shield/>, those <Shield/> are spent
      from the ship card.

### Energy (<Energy/>)

Energy (<Energy/>) are charges used only by huge ships (see [Appendix: Huge Ships](/article/Huge_Ships)).
