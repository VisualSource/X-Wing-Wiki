<Header title="ACTIVATION PHASE" version="1.4.6" />

The Activation Phase is the third phase of a [round](/article/Round). During this phase, each
ship **ACTIVATES**, one at a time, starting with the ship with the lowest [initiative](/article/Initiative)
and continuing in ascending order.

Each ship activates by resolving the following steps in order:

1. **Reveal Dial:** The ship's assigned [dial](/article/Dail) is **REVEALED** by flipping it faceup and then placing it next to its ship card.

1. **Execute Maneuver:** The ship executes the [maneuver](/article/Maneuver) selected on the
   revealed dial.

1. **Perform Action:** The ship may perform one [action](/article/Action).

After all ships have activated, players proceed to the [Engagement Phase](/article/Engagement_Phase).

- If a player has multiple ships with the same [initiative](/article/Initiative) value, that player
  activates them in any orderâ€”finishing the entire activation for one ship
  before activating another ship of the same initiative value.

- If multiple players have ships with the same initiative value, [player order](/article/Player_Order)
  is used to determine the sequence. The first player activates all of
  their ships with that initiative value in any order, then the second player
  activates all of their ships with that initiative value in any order.

- When a ship activates, if it skips the Reveal Dial step, it cannot resolve
  any abilities that trigger after the ship reveals its dial.

- A [stressed](/article/Stress) ship cannot execute red maneuvers or perform actions.

- If a stressed ship attempts to execute a red maneuver, the ship executes
  a **STRESS MANEUVER** instead. The stress maneuver is a white [<Straight/> 2]
  maneuver. The [bearing](/article/Bearing), [difficulty](/article/Difficulty), and [speed](/article/Speed) of this maneuver cannot be
  changed unless an ability explicitly affects the stress maneuver.

- If a ship with no active <Forcepower/> attempts to perform a purple maneuver, it
  executes a stress maneuver instead.
