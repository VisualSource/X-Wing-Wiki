Boost represents a pilot activating additional thrusters to move farther
forward. When a ship performs a <Boost/> action, it boosts by following these steps:

1. Choose the [1 <Straight/>], [1 <LeftBank/>], or [1 <RightBank/>] template.
2. Set the template between the ship's front [guides](/article/Guides).
3. Place the ship at the opposite end of the template and slide the rear guides of the ship into the template.
4. Return the template to the [supply](/article/Supply).

- When a player declares to boost a ship, that player also declares whether
  the ship is boosting straight, left, or right.
- While attempting to place a ship to complete a boost, the boost can [fail](/article/fail) if
  any of the following occurs: + The ship's final positions would cause the ship to [overlap](/article/overlap) another ship. + The ship would overlap or [move through](/article/Move_Through) an [obstacle](/article/Obstacle). + The ship's final position would cause it to be outside the play area (and
  therefore would cause that ship to [flee](/article/Flee)).
- If a boost fails, the ship is returned to its prior position before it
  attempted the boost. If this was part of a <Boost/> action, that action fails.
- The player cannot choose to fail a boost if the final position would not
  cause the action to fail.
- Performing a boost does not count as executing a maneuver but does
  count as a move.
- If an ability instructs a ship to boost, this is different than performing
  a <Boost/> action. A ship that boosts without performing the action can still
  perform the <Boost/> action this round.
