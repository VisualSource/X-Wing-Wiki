<Header title="game length and tracking rounds"/>

Standard games are played over twelve rounds. Players track completed
rounds with charge markers. At the start of the game, place twelve charge
markers, flipped to their active sides, near the play area. At the end of each
round, the players flip one charge marker to its inactive side. At the end of the
twelfth round, the game ends.

* If all of one player's ships are destroyed, the game ends at the end of the
current round.
* Players who wish to play a longer or shorter game may agree with their
opponent upon any number of rounds before Setup and place that number
of charge markers for tracking rounds at the start of the game. The game
ends at the end of the last agreed upon round.
