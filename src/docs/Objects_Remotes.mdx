## Buzz Droid Swarm

<ImgCenter src="/images/Buzz_Droid_Swarm.webp" alt="Buzz Droid Swarm" />

**Types:** Device, Remote

**System, Activation, and End Phase:** No effect.

**Engagement Phase:** When you engage, each enemy ship at
range 0 of the buzz droid swarm suffers 1 <Crit/> damage.
Other Rules: After an enemy ship overlaps
or moves through a buzz droid swarm, the
swarm's controlling player relocates it by
aligning the tab to that ship's front or rear
guides (this ship is at range 0 of the swarm).

The swarm cannot be aligned to a set of the
ship's guides if doing so would cause it to overlap
an object. If the swarm cannot be placed at a
chosen set of guides, its controlling
player must align it to the other set
of the ship's guides.

If it cannot be aligned to the other
set, the swarm and the enemy ship
that overlapped or moved through
it each suffer 1 <Hit/> damage.

## Sensor Buoy

<ImgCenter src="/images/Sensor_Buoy.webp" alt="Sensor Buoy" />

**Types:** Device, Remote

Sensor buoys are remotes that come in pairs (one red, and one blue,
each with its own remote card), and are placed by the **SENSOR BUOY
SUITE** upgrade card. Beyond being remotes and interacting with that
card, they have no additional rules.

## Dark Eye Probe Droid

<ImgCenter src="/images/Dark_Eye_Probe_Droid.webp" alt="Dark Eye Prode Droid" />

**Types:** Device, Remote

**System Phase:** The DRK-1 probe droid's controlling player may
choose a [2 <LeftBank/>], [2 <Straight/>], or [2 <RightBank/>] template and any set of the DRK-1's
guides. The player then relocates the remote, placing the DRK-1 at
the other end of the template. It can be placed overlapping an object
this way.

If the DRK-1 overlaps a ship, use the position marker to denote the
ship's position, then place the ship on top of the remote.

**Activation, Engagement, and End Phase:** No effect.

**Other Rules:** While a ship locks an object or jams an enemy ship,
it may measure range from a friendly DRK-1 probe droid.
After an enemy ship executes a maneuver that causes it to overlap a
DRK-1 probe droid, the ship's controller rolls 1 attack die. On a <Focus/>
result, the DRK-1 probe droid suffers 1 <Hit/> damage.

## Commando Team

<TextCenter text="Commando team is a remote." />
<ImgCenter src="/images/Commando_Team_2.webp" alt="Command Team Stats" />

**Types:** Device, Remote.

When this device is dropped, it can be placed by sliding either its front or rear
guides into the opposite end of the template.

**System and End Phase:** No effect.

**Activation Phase:** At the start of this phase, the commando team's
controlling player may choose a [1 <LeftTurn/>], [2 <Straight/>], or [1 <RightTurn/>] template and place it
in the commando team's front guides. The player then relocates the remote
forward, placing the commando team's rear guides at the other end of the
template. The commando team can be placed overlapping an object in this way.
If multiple players have commando teams, player order is used to determine
the sequence (similar to ships).
If the commando team overlaps a ship, use the position marker to denote the
ship's position, then place the ship on top of the remote.

**Engagement Phase:** You cannot attack if there are enemy ships at range

0. Your primary attack is a range 1-2 <RangeBonusIndicator/> attack. To perform an attack you must
   spend 1 <Charge/>. While you perform an attack, you may change 1 <Focus/> result to a <Hit/>
   result.

**Other Rules:** After an enemy ship overlaps a commando team, that ship
gains 1 strain token. After a commando team is placed while being dropped
or relocating, if it is placed underneath one or more enemy ships, those ships
each gain 1 strain token.

## Tracking Torpedoes

<ImgCenter src="/images/Tracking_Torpedoes.webp" alt="Tracking Torpedoes" />

**Types:** Device, Remote

**System Phase:** At this remote's initiative, its
controlling player relocates this remote forward
using the [3 <LeftBank/>], [3 <RightBank/>], or [4 <Straight/>] template.

**Activation Phase:** No effect.
Engagement Phase: At this remote's
initiative, if an object on which it has a lock is in
its <FrontArc/> at range 0-1, this remote detonates.

**End Phase:** During the End Phase, if this
remote does not have a lock on any object, this
remote must acquire a lock on an object in its

<FrontArc /> at range 1-3, if able.

**Other Rules:** After this remote is destroyed,
roll 1 attack die. On a <Hit/> or <Crit/> result, this
remote detonates.

When this remote detonates, each ship, remote,
and structure at range 0 or in its <FrontArc/> at range 1
rolls 4 attack dice and suffers 1 damage for each
matching <Hit/> and <Crit/> result.
