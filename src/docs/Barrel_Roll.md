Pilots can barrel roll to move their ship laterally and adjust their position. When a small ship performs :barrel-roll: a action, it barrel rolls by following these steps:

1. Take the [1 :straight:] template.
2. Place the narrow edge of the template flush aginst, the left or right side of the ship's base. The template must be placed with the middle line of the template aligned with the hashmark on the isde of the base.
3. Lift the ship off the play surface, then place the ship with the hashmark on the side of the base aligned to hte front, middle, or back of the other narrow end of the template.
4. Return the emplate to the [supply](/rules/Supply).

![Barrel Roll](tie_barrel_roll.webp)

> A TIE fighter barrel rolls to the right and slightly forward, slightly backward, or straight across.

When a [medium or large ship](/rules/Ship_Sizes) barrel rolls, subsitute "long edge" for "narrow edge" in the above description.

![Barrel Roll](punisher_barrel_roll.webp)

> A TIE Pusisher barrel rolls to the right.

- When a player declares to barrel roll a ship, that player also declares
  whether the ship is barrel rolling to the left or right. Then, while
  attempting to place the ship, the player may attempt to place the ship at
  the front, middle, and back before choosing one of those positions.

- While attempting to place a ship to complete a barrel roll, the barrel roll
  can [fail](/rules/Fail) if any of the following occurs:

  - All three positions would cause the ship to [overlap](/rules/Overlap) another ship.

  - All three positions would cause the ship to overlap or [move through](/rules/Move) an [obstacle](/rules/Obstacle).

  - All three positions would cause the ship to be outside the play area (and therefore would cause that ship to [flee](/rules/Flee)).

- If a barrel roll fails, the ship is returned to its prior position before it
  attempted the barrel roll. If this was part of a :barrel-roll: action, that action fails.

- The player cannot choose to fail a barrel roll if one of the three positions
  would not cause the action to fail.

- Performing a barrel roll does not count as executing a [maneuver](/rules/Maneuver) but does
  count as a [move](/rules/Move).
- If an ability instructs a ship to barrel roll, this is different than performing
  a :barrel-roll: action. A ship that barrel rolls without performing the action can
  still perform the :barrel-roll: action this round.
