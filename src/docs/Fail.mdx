<Header version="1.4.4" title="FAIL" />

Some effects can **FAIL**, which means the effect did not resolve as intended and
instead is resolved in a default way.

- A ship can fail when it [barrel rolls](/article/Barrel_Roll), [boosts](/article/Boost), [coordinates](/article/Coordinate), [decloaks](/article/Cloak), [deploys](/article/Deploy),
  [jams](/article/Jam), [locks](/article/Lock), or [SLAMs](/article/SLAM).
- An effect that fails does not trigger any effects that would occur after a
  ship resolves that effect.
- If an action fails, the player does not choose a different action to perform
  and cannot choose to resolve the effect in a different way.
- If an action fails, since the action was not completed, that ship cannot
  perform a [linked action](/article/Linked_Action).
- After a red action fails, the ship gains a [stress](/article/Stress) token.
