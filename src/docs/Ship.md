A ship is composed of a plastic miniature, base, pegs, a ship
token, and ID tokens.

- A ship's plastic miniature must match the ship's type as indicated on the
  ship card.
- A ship must use the dial that matches the [ship's type](/rules/Ship_Type).
- Some plastic miniatures extend beyond their plastic base. For this reason,
  the miniature does not affect any game mechanics. The miniature may
  overlap obstacles and hang over the edge of the [play area](/rules/Play_Area) without issue.

If a miniature would touch another miniature or disrupt a ship's
movement, the players should add or remove one peg from the base to
prevent this contact. Otherwise, the players can temporarily remove the
miniature from its base until ships have moved to allow it to be returned.
