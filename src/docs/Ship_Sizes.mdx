<Header title="Ship sizes" />

There are four different ship sizes: small, medium, large, and huge.

A small ship uses a plastic base that is about 1-9/16” (4 cm) long. The rules
of **X-Wing** are written for small ships and therefore there are no special
exceptions for small ships.

A medium ship uses a plastic base that is about 2-3/8” (6 cm) long. Medium
ships have the following exceptions:

- A medium ship requires two [ion](/article/Ion) tokens before it is ionized and two tractor
  tokens before it is tractored.
- Medium ships [barrel roll](/article/Barrel_Roll) differently (including while [decloaking](/article/Cloak)).
  A large ship uses a plastic base that is about 3-1/8” (8 cm) long. Large ships
  have the following exceptions:
- A large ship requires three ion tokens before it is ionized and three
  tractor tokens before it is tractored.
- Large ships barrel roll differently (including while decloaking).
- During [setup](/article/Setup), a large ship's base may extend outside of range 1 as long
  as it fills the length of that area. A large ship cannot be placed with any
  portion of its base outside the play area.

A huge ship uses an extra large plastic base. Huge ships have many additional
rules. They were introduced in the first edition of
**X-Wing** and will be
reintroduced in an upcoming product.
