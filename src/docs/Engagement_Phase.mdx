<Header title="Engagement phase" version="1.4.4" />

The Engagement Phase is the fourth phase of the [round](/article/Round). During this phase,
each ship **ENGAGES**, one at a time, starting with the ship with the highest
[initiative](/article/Initiative) and continues in descending order.

When a ship engages, it may perform an [attack](/article/Attack).

- After all ships of a given initiative have engaged, all destroyed ships are
  removed. Then, continuing in descending order, this process continues with all
  ships of the same initiative engaging and then removing all destroyed ships.
- If a player has multiple ships with the same [initiative](/article/Initiative), the player engages
  them in any order, engaging one ship before engaging another ship of the
  same initiative value.
- If multiple players have ships with the same initiative, [player order](/article/Player_Order) is used
  to determine the order. The first player engages all of their ships of a given
  initiative before the second player engages all of their ships of that initiative.
- [Disarmed](/article/Disarmed) ships still engage even though they cannot perform attacks.
- Each ship engages only once during this phase.
