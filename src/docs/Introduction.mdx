This reference is the definitive source for all
**Star Wars: X-Wing rules.**
Unlike the Rulebook, this reference addresses complex and unusual gameplay
situations.
The main component of this guide is a glossary of important game terms,
organized alphabetically. There are several appendices beginning on [page 23](/article/4).

### GOLDEN RULES

If a rule in this guide contradicts the Rulebook, the rule in this guide takes
precedence.
If the ability of a card conflicts with the rules in this guide, the card ability
takes precedence.
If a card ability uses the word “cannot,” that effect is absolute and cannot be
overridden by other effects.
During an attack or while otherwise resolving an effect involving dice, each die
cannot be rerolled more than once.

### ERRATA AND CONFLICTS

If there is a conflict when resolving a game effect between different
translations and/or printings of cards, the most recent English printing takes
precedent. The most recent card text can be found in the Errata available at
[www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-documents](https://www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-documents "external").
