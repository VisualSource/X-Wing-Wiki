Pilots can reinforce to angle their deflector shields and
increase the defensiveness of a portion of their ship. When a
ship performs the <Reinforce/> action, it gains a reinforce token with
either the fore or aft side faceup.

A ship is **REINFORCED** while it has a reinforce token assigned
to it. Reinforce tokens are circular, green tokens. While a
reinforced ship defends, if the attacker is inside the full arc specified by the
reinforce token and not in the other full arc, the token provides an effect.

The attacker needs to be in the defender's <FullFrontArc/> arc for the fore reinforce token
or be in the defender's <FullRearArc/> arc for the aft reinforce token.

<TextCenter text="In this example, since the VT-49 Decimator has a fore
reinforce token, the effect would only apply while defending
against the one X-wing in front of it."/>

During the Neutralize Results step, if the [attack](/article/Attack) would [hit](/article/Hit) and there is more
than one <Hit/>/<Crit/> result remaining, one <Evade/> result is added to cancel one result.

* A ship can have more than one reinforce token. If a ship has multiple of
the same type of reinforce token, their effects are applied one at a time.
Thus, for two reinforce tokens to both apply their effect, there would need
to be at least three <Hit/>/<Crit/> results remaining.
* When a ship gains a reinforce token, unless specified otherwise, the
player that controls that ship chooses whether it gains a fore reinforce
token or an aft reinforce token.
* A ship does not spend the reinforce token when resolving its effect.
* If an ability instructs a ship to gain one reinforce token, this is different
than performing a <Reinforce/> action. A ship that gains the token without
performing the action can still perform the <Reinforce/> action this round.
* Reinforce can be used against attacks at range 4-5 even the defender's
<FullFrontArc/> or <FullRearArc/> normally only extends to range 3. If the attacker is at range
4-5, treat the defender's <FullFrontArc/> or <FullRearArc/> arc as extending to range 5 for the
purposes of determining which arc the defender is in for reinforce (but not
for any other effects or abilities).
