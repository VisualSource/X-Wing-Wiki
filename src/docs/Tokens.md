Some abilities cause ships to gain, spend, or remove tokens. Tokens are used to track effects and come in a variety of colors.

- When a ship is instructed to **GAIN** a token, a token from the supply is placed in the play area next to the ship.
- When a ship is instructed to **SPEND** a token or there is an instruction to **REMOVE** a token from a ship, a token of that type is returned from that ship to the supply.

- When a ship is instructed to **TRANSFER** a token to another ship, it is removed from that ship and assigned to the other ship. 
  + If a ship involved in a transfer is not able to remove or gain the token involved, the transfer cannot take place.

### Token Colors And Shapes

To help with memory, the token's color and shape indicates both when the token is removed and whether the effect is positive or negative.

- Green and orange tokens are removed during the End Phase. These tokens are both circular.
- Blue and red tokens have special criteria for when they can be removed or spent. These tokens are diamond shaped.

Additionally:

- The physical position of a token in the play area does not provide any effect and is merely representational of belonging to the ship.
