Pilots can coordinate to assist their allies. When a ship performs the <Coordinate/>
action, it coordinates. A **COORDINATING** ship is a ship that is attempting to
coordinate by performing the following steps:

1. Measure range from the coordinating ship to any friendly ships.
2. Choose another friendly ship at range 1-2.
3. The chosen ship may perform one action.

Additionally:

* While a ship coordinates, the coordinate fails if no valid ship is chosen.
    + If the chosen ship attempts to perform an action but that action fails,
the coordinate does not fail.

* If an ability instructs a ship to coordinate, this is different than performing
a <Coordinate/> action.
    + A ship that coordinates without performing the action can still perform
    the <Coordinate/> action this round.
